Skybound Journal,

The skies of hell are like no other. Dark, fiery, and full of deceit. Today we faced the reforming gaze—a beholder, a storm in itself. The high reformist wanted a show. A dance, a song, a battle. “Teach me of your might,” he said. I could feel the storm inside me. The clouds, the thunder, the wind. The storm called to me.

Bog started us off with beats from his drum. Vaelith joined, his harp playing songs of a past long gone. Corman danced, bold and sure. But the reformist wanted blood, not song. “A performance to the death,” he laughed. The doors closed. We’re trapped on this floating rock.

The beholder floats above us, an eye as big as the sun. It watches, it waits. Its gaze, a storm of its own. Magic flickers, weak like fire in the rain. We’re grounded, but I won’t break. I shifted, became the hornet. Big, bold, strong. The sky’s my ally, even here in hell.

Corman’s touch, the blessing of haste, fell silent under the gaze. But I won’t be silenced. I stand ready, wings buzzing, storm inside. The others stand firm, too. Eirik and Vaelith, floating like clouds. Morty, Bog, Corman—all grounded, yet unbroken.

The storm is brewing. The fight is upon us. I won’t fail. Not again. The skies remember my promise. I will protect the innocent, redeem my name, honor my fallen wingmate. I won’t let this storm take me. Not this time.

Until the next entry, skies guide me.
