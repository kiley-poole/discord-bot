**Field Report: The Crossing and Encounter**

Navigating the abyssal underbelly of Phlegethos continues to be an exercise in balancing ambition with survival. Our passage through the River Styx—an endeavor that saw the demise of two Thayan apprentices—was a stark reminder that sentiment is an extravagance I cannot afford. They served their purpose, their lives reduced to mere tokens in our desperate bid for passage. The cost of doing business in Hell, it seems, is the flesh of the naive.

The Crossing Lord, a greater devil, amused itself with our plight, eager to exchange information for safe passage. I find their interest in Tanar’ri as tiresome as it is predictable—each seeking advantage in the eternal struggle. Their vanity, however, remains an exploitable weakness. Morty’s creative execution of the apprentice—both gruesome and efficient—earned us a soul coin and satisfied the Crossing Lord’s appetite for pain. I remind myself that such alliances are transient, as is trust.

Our voyage brought us face to face with Vol’Zun, a pit fiend whose arrogance matched his size. The creature, missing its left claw—a trophy in Bog’s possession—challenged our presence. I must acknowledge that my decision to engage was... audacious. A calculated risk, some might argue, but in truth, a testament to my disdain for infernal authority. Asmodeus’s intervention was unexpected, yet revealing. His words, cloaked in riddles, hint at the intricate politics of Hell that even I must consider. The devil is gone...for now.

Corman’s outburst was an unfortunate display of misplaced loyalty. His naivety in matters of infernal diplomacy is a hindrance, but not unexpected. I do not answer to Lathander's light, nor to the whims of a paladin unacquainted with the realities of our quest. Our paths are bound by necessity, not by allegiance.

We have arrived at Tempelos, the Mouth of Iron. Here, we shall execute the trade as per the proprietor’s directive. Our journey is far from over. The cacophony of devilish commerce awaits, and I remain the vigilant navigator in this hellscape of ambition and betrayal. I am reminded that trust is a fool's luxury, sentiment clouds judgment, and in this land of eternal fire, we must remain ever two steps ahead.
