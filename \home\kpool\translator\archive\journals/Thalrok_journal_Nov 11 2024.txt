Skywatch Log,

The storms weren't just in the sky today. The winds whispered of danger, and they didn't lie. The monastery burned, and we fought the fire with steel and grit. Salamanders fell, but their heat lingered in my bones. The smell of smoke clings to me still.

We wandered the desert, the heat a second skin. Found a druid, sneaky one he was, tried to ambush us with spiders. The wind whispered of his approach, and we sent him scurrying. Can always trust the wind.

Back to Lesvath, to the underbelly of the city. The slums feel like the bottom of a storm cloud, heavy with the promise of rain. Eldrick joined us, haphazard and loyal as always. Set up Nitya's telescope, the Gaze of the Far Wanderer. Saw the bay explode before it happened. The storm called out to me, a warning in its voice.

The Nameless Tavern, a meeting place for secrets and danger. Smuggling folks out of Lesvath, that's the deal. My amulet, the key to staying unseen, avoiding eyes that pry. It's a heavy weight around my neck. They needed me, but the skies felt wrong.

Nitya questioned the arcane challenge. Thoughts of Valra, my wingmate, weighed on me. Could I trust this magic? Could she? Corman and the others, they don't see the skies like I do. They don't hear the whispers.

Went into the Nameless Tavern alone. The tension was thick, like a storm waiting to break. They wanted passage through the checkpoints, past the Scrying Sentinels. My amulet, their hope. But the man, dangerous with a vest of purple hum. The explosion we sawâ€”the storm's fury in his hands. The price was high, too high. Walked out invisible, left the chest of gold behind. Not worth it. Not worth Valra's memory.

The storm broke. Heard it rumble even from the Pit of Eternal Servitude. The tavern gone, just like I saw. The choices linger like rain that won't wash away. Didn't fail, not this time. The skies watch, and I vowed not to fall again.

Tomorrow, the games continue. The thrill of pushing the limits calls to me. I'll bend the rules if I must. Loyalty to my comrades, to my oath, that's what matters. The skies demand it, and I won't disappoint.
