Another day, another round of fighting idiotic creatures in this gods-forsaken vault. The Thayans really know how to put the "wonder" in "Bound Wonders," don't they? Watching those diopsids flail around was the best comedy I've seen in ages. They could barely keep their tentacles straight. But of course, the real entertainment came from the so-called champions I'm stuck with.

Eirik swinging that maul around like it’s some divine gift. A few hits landed, but I swear, he’s more in love with that piece of metal than anything else in this world. Wish he'd knock some sense into himself instead. Morty, our new undead buddy, what a charming addition. Nothing like a corpse to lift the spirits. Corman, he’s all about trust now—apparently even undead are worth our faith. Lathander must be rolling in his celestial realm.

Nitya tried to be the smart one, but trust only goes so far, right? She’s convinced herself she can read the threads of fate. Good luck with that. I’ll stick with my flask, thank you. It’s the only thing around here I can actually trust. And Thalrok, the druid—his whole bee business is buzzing, but I wonder if he even knows what the hell he’s doing half the time.

Lost a few minutes stomping some diopsid spawn—a satisfying bit of work, I’ll admit. But all the while, my mind’s stuck on that damn scythe and the village it ruined. The Tharkian promises answers, but you know how that goes. Promises are as empty as a sober pint.

Spared a thought for Henk today. We’re still chasing shadows trying to find him. Maybe Miranda’s smirk holds some answers. Hell, maybe it doesn’t, but punching her smug face might be the only highlight if it comes to that.

No rest for the wicked, they say. Well, no rest for the drunken either. As long as there’s ale and a bit of chaos, I’ll manage. This place keeps throwing its curveballs, but I’m still here, hoof and all. Just a satyr with a flask, watching the world stumble around like it’s had one too many. Cheers to that, I guess.
