Storm Journal,

The sky roared for blood today. In the twilight of the Kestris, we stood as the skies darkened, waiting for the storm to break. The Pryador Thark, our nemesis, stood across the arena. Their magic felt like a heavy storm cloud, threatening to swallow us whole. But we did not flinch. The wind whispered of danger, but it also sang of courage. I felt it in my veins, an old friend urging me forward, reminding me of why I fight. For honor. For redemption. For those who can no longer soar beside me.

The battle was fierce, a dance of death under the eyes of the Tharchion. Lysia Moonshadow flew like a falcon, but Eirik’s swing grounded her. Morty's blades found their mark, cutting through the air like lightning. The Soul Drinker—a vampire, a storm in its own right—tried to consume us, but Bog held strong, even when doubt clouded his mind. The vampire fell, turned to stone, a monument to its hubris.

Miranda, the succubus, laughed at our struggle. Her voice twisted with Henk’s torment. I felt the storm rage within, a tempest of anger and sorrow. Corman, poor Corman, caught in the web of her deceit. But we are Skyguard. We do not yield. As the statue of the Soul Drinker crushed Miranda, the skies above seemed to clear, a brief moment of peace in the chaos.

The winds have calmed now. The storm has passed, leaving only the echo of battle in its wake. But my heart still aches for the skies and for my lost wingmate. I will not fail again. Not this time. The wind carries my promise, a vow to protect those who still breathe the sky.

Tomorrow, we fight again. Another challenge, another chance to prove ourselves. The Thayan Games are not yet over, but neither are we. I bent the rules today, but it was necessary. The sky demands victory, and I shall answer its call, for Broghan, for Eirik, for Morty, for Corman, and for those who've fallen.

The storm rests for now.
