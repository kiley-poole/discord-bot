Field Report: The Kestris Encounter

Under the twisted dance of Tharkion's twilight magic, we squared off against the Pryador Thark. The air of the Grand Arena heavy with the weight of our task. Trust is a fool's luxury, and I had no intention of indulging. These Thayan Games demand only precision and cold resolve.

The succubus, Miranda, with her seductive menace, manipulated poor Hank to his demise. I have no room for sentiment; his loss is a tactical disadvantage. Yet, his echo in Miranda's taunts still grates against my mind. The mission remains clear—eliminate the threat, take no prisoners. Sentiment clouds judgment, and I can't afford that.

Corman, Eric, Thalrock, Bog, and Morty—each played their role, though some grappled with their own demons. Strange how alliances form when survival is the only option. Lysia Moonshadow's flight, the red wizards' arcane arrogance, all fell before us. They underestimated us—a miscalculation they paid for with their lives.

The Soul Drinker, a vampiric testament to the games' malevolence, now a stone form—a fitting end. I'll admit, Thalrock's accidental precision in dispatching Miranda with that statue was an unexpected delight. Still, her voice haunts—a reminder of vulnerabilities masked beneath bravado.

The undead shall not regenerate under the searing light of our resolve. Witnessing Miranda crushed into oblivion was satisfying, though her illusions of Hank still taunt the edges of my mind, a reminder of unresolved shadows.

This alliance is an uneasy one, forged in necessity rather than trust. Yet, in this arena of death, perhaps that is enough. We'll see if it holds beyond the games. The relay awaits—a testament of skill, teamwork, and perhaps, a fleeting glimpse of what semblance of purpose I might find in this chaos.

For now, the mission remains—to prove that I am in control of my destiny, scars and all. The Kestris was a step, but the path is far from clear. Calculations were off by a margin. Unacceptable. Victory demands unwavering vigilance.

End Report.
