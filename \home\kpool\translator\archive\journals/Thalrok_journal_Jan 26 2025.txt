Dear Sky Journal,

The sea of fire roared beneath us today. The air was thick with heat, and the sky poured blood. A sight that'd make even a storm cower. The ship moved like it had a mind, all thanks to my will. Felt Goose with me—the mountain winds pushing us away from the demons. That was something.

Shodak and Canerteth showed their ugly faces again. The abyss can't keep its claws to itself. They wanted Nitya. The past always has a way of clawing back at you, doesn't it? Their ship came alongside us like a shadow ready to pounce. I felt the weight of Goose's loss, and the wind answered my call. They were tossed into the sea like leaves in a gale. The fire took them, swallowed them whole. The thought of Goose kept me steady, kept me focused. I had to—couldn't let them take another friend.

The fear of failure, it's still there. I won't deny it. It's like a storm cloud always on the horizon. But today, it felt lighter. The crew, they stood their ground. Corman's light banished the flyers. Morty's blades flew true. Eirik and Bog, their strength like the mountains. Nitya steered us through the chaos even when her heart was heavy. We're a storm, a force together. The Lords' Alliance, a bond forged in fire and battle.

The rule-bending, the fight—it felt right. The thrill of it, the taste of the wind. Reckless? Maybe. But necessary. The skies whisper of more challenges ahead, but I won't fail my friends again. Not this time. The sea of flames can't stop us. We're bound for glory, and I can feel the winds at our back.

To the skies,

Thalrok "Skystorm" Stonefist
