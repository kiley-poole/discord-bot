Skyward Thoughts,

The morning broke with a whisper of the wind. I felt the storm's call, urging me to rise. Our pit of endless servitude seemed more like a cage today, but the skyguards were restless, myself included. Corman's calisthenics ain't no flight through the clouds, but it was a start. 

Our new companion, Morty, chose rest over action. Wise, maybe. But my mind was set on the skies. I wonder if he feels the call of the storm like I do, or if he's bound to the earth forever. 

Together, we headed back to Nitya’s apartment. I could see the weight of the world on Corman’s shoulders. He's got the heart of a warrior, but sometimes his mind is in the clouds. As we moved, I felt the winds shifting around us, whispering tales of danger. 

Eldrick was alive. His presence filled the room with something I couldn't quite place. It's like a breeze carrying the scent of rain before it falls. We spoke of the games and Pryador's illusions. A gust of doubt, perhaps, but I reminded myself that the skies hold no fear for those who soar. We are the Lords Alliance. We are the best of the best. 

The monastery called to us next. The journey was long, the air hot, but the breeze carried the promise of something more. I felt it in my bones. But when we arrived, the flames had already claimed it. I tried to snuff them out, like blotting the sun with a cloud, but these flames were different. Dark magic. Unnatural. My hands itched with the need to help, to do something. But sometimes even the sky's fury isn't enough.

The battle with the salamanders was fierce. Fire against storm. I became the Wok Wok, a beast of flight and fury, and the skies were mine once more. But the pain of the flames was a reminder of my limits. We fought hard, and though I tasted the bitter ash of defeat for a moment, we stood victorious. Corman's last blow was that of a hero. I saw my wingmate in him, for just a heartbeat.

The stone Bog found is curious. It sings to him, like the wind around the peaks. I see its lure, but it holds no sway over my storm-touched heart. It's a reminder of the past and the lost, but my eyes are set forward. On redemption. On honor.

As the skies darkened, Nitya's vision showed us the harbor and the portents of something terrible. The explosion she saw... the skies will burn, and the seas will rage. We have little time, but I won't fail again. Not this time.

Tonight, I meet with those who need to flee Lesvath. The winds will guide us. They call it reckless; I call it necessary. The storm's heart beats in my chest, and I am its keeper. For my wingmate, and for those who soar. I'll see this through.

The skies are heavy with promise and peril. I feel them with every breath. I won't fail again. Not this time.
