Day 5 of the Thayan Games – Demonic Detour in Phlegethos

Ah, what a delightful day it has been. The flavor of the abyss clings to the air, a scent so intoxicating it’s almost a shame to leave. But leave we must, lest our bones be the next to char in the lava sea's embrace. Let’s recount the day's macabre dance, shall we?

The Tidal Wave of Revenge
Body Score: 0/10 (Reduced to Ash)
Kanertath and Shodak, those delightful nuisances, had a rather unfortunate encounter with the lava sea. They came back for Nitya, their fury still a sight to behold. I must admit, watching them flail and succumb to the fiery depths was a spectacle I won't soon forget. Alas, no body to tally here; the lava sea claimed them entirely. Still, their demise was a reminder of the dangers lurking beneath every molten wave. Possession Likelihood: Nonexistent.

The Apprentices of Mayhem
Body Score: 3/10 (One Down, Two to Go)
Our conjuration apprentices, bless their terrified hearts, tried to hold their own. One, unfortunately, is now feeding the lava, his body a vessel for a sap demon. It was amusing, wasn't it? Watching Bog feign the shove as a stumble. A pity, though. The others, red as boiled lobsters, still cling to life. Their usefulness is limited, but they've shown resilience. Possession Likelihood: Moderate, if desperation calls.

Our Motley Crew
Body Score: Variable
Corman shines his light obnoxiously bright, both a bane and boon. I enjoy watching him try to reason with demons—it's like watching a dog bark at the moon. Thalrok’s wind, however, now that was a show of force. His command over the elements is... impressive. If only his form matched his power. Nitya, poor thing, reliving her torment—her distress is palpable. I wonder if she will break before we leave this infernal place. Possession Likelihood: High for Corman (should his faith waver), Moderate for Thalrok (if his mind cracks), and Low for Nitya (not quite yet).

As for me, the sea whispers secrets that only the dead can hear. Even here, amidst the fire and fury, I find clarity. The echoes of my past lives converge, reminding me of my purpose. A ghastly dance it is, but one I perform with grace. I will continue to watch, to wait, and perhaps... to seize opportunity when it arises.

Until next time, dear journal. Let the games continue.
