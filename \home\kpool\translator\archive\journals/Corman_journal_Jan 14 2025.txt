Dear Book of Words,

Today was hard. We was in a big fight. A Kestris. Lots of bad folks from Pryador Thark. It was scarry. I counted five bad guys. But I was wrong. I thinked there was more, but my head got all mixed up. My friends were brave and strong. I tried to help. I want to be brave for Lathander, like he says. 

There was a vampire called Soul Drinker. He was mean. And Miranda, she was a demon. She made me do bad things. I hit my friends. I didn’t want to. But she tricked me. I feel sad and scared. She used magic on my mind. Eirik was mad. He said Miranda hurt Henk. I hope Henk is okay. I don’t know. I feel lost.

My friends are good. Thalrok was a big bee. He was strong. He dropped a rock on Miranda. She didn’t laugh after that. Bog was fast. Morty threw magic blades. Nitya made fire and light. Eirik was mad but strong. He helped me when I was lost.

I hit the vampire with Lathander’s Glory. It was shiny. Made me feel strong. But it was hard. I was tired and hurt. I want to be better for my friends. I want to make Lathander proud. 

I hope Henk is out there somewhere. I miss him. I will keep looking. I won’t give up. I feel scared, but I have to try. For Henk, for the little folks, and for Lathander.

Till next time, Book of Words.
