Dear Book,

Today was real busy. We did lots. Started with some good morning stretches. I had to tell Eirik how important it is to get a good stretch. He did them with me. Bog just looked and gave his middle finger. I laughed. Then we went to the slums. Nitya wanted us to check on Eldrick. He was okay, eating curry. I didn’t know what curry was. Smelled spicy. We met a turtle person too. He was nice and gave us things. I got my javelins back. He had spiders. Big ones. They were scary, but turtle man was nice. I think spiders were his friends.

Then it got wild. We went to a monastery. It was on fire. Burning big. Fire magic. Couldn’t put it out. Inside was lizard men. Big and mean. One was really big. Eirik and I fought them. I got real mad. Lathander helped me hit the big one with my sword. It was like a big light. It exploded. Hurt a lot. I fell. Eirik saved me. He’s my friend. I owe him now. Nitya said something about the future and explosions. That sounds bad. I gotta think about what it means. My head hurts a little.

We gotta help Thalrok later. I hope it goes good. I want everyone to be safe. I try real hard. Lathander says protect the good folks, and I will. Like Mom always said, do your best, even if it’s tough. I’m strong. I’ll do it.

Goodnight, Book.
