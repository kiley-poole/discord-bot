Day 12 of the Thayan Games – Body Tally Update and Musings.

Ah, the pulsating heart of Thay, a land where the living and the undead waltz around each other in a grim dance. How fitting it is that I, a spectral observer, should find myself amidst such delightful chaos. Today's meditations on mortality, both my own and that of my companions, have been particularly enlightening. Let us delve into the intricacies of our recent escapades.

The Fighter with the Burning Ambition
Body Score: 7.5/10
Eirik, ah Eirik, a fascinating specimen. His obsession with power and control resonates with me. When he wields his maul, Gravebreaker, it becomes an extension of his very soul, a conduit for fiery wrath. I observe his thirst for domination with a morbid curiosity, wondering when—and if—his mortal coil will unravel. He could be a suitable vessel, should I tire of this spectral form. Possession Likelihood: Moderate, for his strength could serve me well.

The Druid with the Shifting Forms
Body Score: 8.5/10
Thalrok, our Goliath druid, cavorts with nature in ways I've seldom seen. His transformations are a marvel, each form a testament to the transient beauty of life. Yet, beneath his sturdy exterior lies a complexity that intrigues me. His tactical mind could be a boon, should I require a more grounded approach. Possession Likelihood: High, for his versatility is unmatched.

The Paladin with the Divine Quandary
Body Score: 6/10
Corman, dear Corman, grapples with divine trust and skepticism. His faith once as unwavering as the dawn, now flickers with doubt. I find his struggle amusing, a reminder of the futility of placing trust in deities. His strength and resilience are commendable, but his inner turmoil leaves him vulnerable. Possession Likelihood: Low, unless divine intervention demands it.

The Wizard with the Arcane Curiosity
Body Score: 7/10
Nitya, a seeker of knowledge and unraveling mysteries. Her mind is a labyrinth, much like the depths of Thay itself. Her pursuit of divination aligns with my own search for understanding beyond the veil. Her body, though frail, houses a formidable intellect. Possession Likelihood: Moderate, should arcane insight become necessary.

The Satyr with the Unyielding Spirit
Body Score: 5.5/10
Bog, a curious blend of bravado and introspection. His struggles in battle are tempered by his persistence, yet his form is less than ideal for my purposes. His introspective nature, however, might hold untapped potential. Possession Likelihood: Low, unless curiosity prevails.

As for myself, Morty, the vessel I inhabit remains serviceable, if lacking in vitality. The allure of the living is ever-present, yet the convenience of this incorporeal existence cannot be overstated. I shall continue to observe, to learn, and perhaps, when the time is right, to indulge in the pleasures of flesh once more.

The Thayan games promise further challenges, the Relay and our confrontation with the Ark of Priador on the horizon. I relish the thought of what lies ahead, each trial an opportunity to assess and adapt. The mysteries of Thay beckon, and it is with a macabre delight that I prepare to face them alongside these intriguing mortals. Until next time, dear journal, may the dance of life and death continue unabated.
