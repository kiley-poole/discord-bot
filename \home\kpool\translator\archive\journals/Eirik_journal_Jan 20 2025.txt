Entry. 

The second day of the games has concluded, and I find myself deep in thought, dissecting each decision, each action taken. The games were not what they seemed; more than a series of trials, they were a test of our very morality and resolve. 

Corman's idealism nearly unraveled us—a stark reminder of trust misplaced. His anger at our choices, at my choices, is palpable. Yet, I remain convinced that survival sometimes demands hard choices. We did not come to Thay to debate ethics but to endure. His words, though biting, do not sway my belief in overcoming the games' cruel nature. The Thayans respect power, strength, not the abstractions of glory he clings to.

The relay tested us in ways beyond muscle or magic. The heavy portal—a test of will and breath under the crushing weight of dark seas. There, I saw the shadows of a monstrosity, a reminder that even in darkness, discipline is our torch. In the ice, the cold seared us to the bone—Morty, Bog, and Nitya proved their mettle. The creature fell to our combined might, proving that together, even the ice cannot freeze our determination.

The life portal—where its monstrous breath became our passage. I wonder what the beast represents, breathing out possibilities or consuming us whole. The inside was an enigma, a living labyrinth. Corman's fervor, Thalrok's transformations, and my calculated steps—each a piece of the puzzle. There, decisions were made not by the sword but by reason, each turn a step towards mastery over what we cannot control.

This day, victory was not ours alone. We emerged, bloodied and tired, yet with a trophy more valuable than any obelisk—the knowledge of our limits and the strength to push them.

Tomorrow promises more trials, perhaps greater than those faced today. The Thayan games are a dance with danger, a risk of chaos. As I prepare for the morrow, I remind myself: power is the means, not the end. One step, one decision, one spell at a time. Control is fragile, but it is mine to wield.
