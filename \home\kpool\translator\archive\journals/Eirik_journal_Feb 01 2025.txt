Entry,

The journey through Phlegethos continues to test the limits of our endurance and resolve. Our arrival at Tempelos, the Mouth of Iron, marks a temporary reprieve, though not without considerable turmoil preceding it. 

The passage through the River Styx demanded a price—one I had not anticipated paying. The conjuration apprentices, their deaths, were a necessity, a cold calculus in a realm where morality is an abstract luxury. Their sacrifice, while brutal, was a means to an end—a step closer to fulfilling the proprietor's inscrutable quest. I can feel the weight of their souls, though I refuse to burden myself with their guilt. It was a pragmatic decision, one that served the greater goal, yet it will not escape my memory.

The crossing lord's presence reminded us of the pervasive power dynamics that govern the hells. Even as we tread lightly, the fetters of this realm's politics bind us, a constant reminder of the fragile control we hold. Yet, control we must maintain. The entity's agreement to ferry us was a negotiation of necessity, a transaction of souls for safety.

The encounter with the pit fiend, Volzun, revealed the fragility of composure under the weight of true power. Its presence was a stark reminder of our vulnerability, a force that dwarfed the might of our assembled party. In the face of Nitya's audacity, I found myself torn—admiring her boldness yet wary of the risks it invited. I cannot deny the thrill of invoking Asmodeus himself, a gamble that paid off with a reprieve, though at the risk of our lives. Her independence is reckless, a wild card that I foresee dragging us into the abyss if not checked.

As we dock at Tempelos, the echoes of our harrowing journey here resonate within me. Each devil bargained with, each soul traded, etch deeper lines into the ledger of my conscience. The path to redemption is fraught with these scars, reminders of the control I seek to master. The succubus blood we carry represents not just commerce, but a chance to tip the scales toward achieving our mission. 

I must stay vigilant, to steer my actions with precision, to harness the magic within me responsibly. Every spell cast, every decision made, must be a reflection of discipline, for power unchecked is power wasted. This expedition through the hells is a crucible, one that may either forge a sharper edge or lay bare my flaws. I remain resolute, even as doubt edges at the periphery of my thoughts. There is no room for another oversight, no space for another regret.

Never again.
