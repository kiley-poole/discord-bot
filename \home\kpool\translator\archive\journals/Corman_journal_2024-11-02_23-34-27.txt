Dear Book,

Today was a busy day. We did a lot in this big place called Thay. It’s a strange place with lots of magic and odd things. I’m still trying to keep up with all that’s going on.

We fought these big bugs called diopsids. They were scary with their big pinchers and tentacles. I rode Dusk, my horse, and tried to be brave like Lathander wants. Dusk got hurt, but I think we did good. Thalrok turned into a big bee and helped, which was cool. Everyone fought hard, and we beat the bugs. I hope the little folks would be proud.

Then we met a strange spirit named Morty. He’s an undead, which is weird because I’m not supposed to like undead. But Nitya and Eirik say he can help us. I asked Lathander if we can trust him, and I felt like the answer was yes. That made me think hard because undead aren’t usually good. But maybe Morty is different. Still, I’m keeping an eye on him just in case.

We also talked to a powerful lady named Tharkian Val. She said there’s a big problem in Thay we need to help with. It feels important, but also scary. I want to do what’s right and help the good folks, but I’m worried. Nitya says not to trust anyone, but I want to trust my friends. It’s hard to know what to do sometimes.

I’m tired but gotta keep going. The Thayan games are coming up, and we need to be ready. It’s a lot to think about. I just wanna be strong and brave for everyone counting on me. I hope I can make Lathander proud and help my friends too.

Night, Book.
