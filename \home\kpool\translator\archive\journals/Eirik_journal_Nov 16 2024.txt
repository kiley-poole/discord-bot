Entry of Eirik Thorne

The city of Lesvath, a boiling pot of ambition and peril. Today, marked by the Weakness Purge, has affirmed the importance of discipline, yet the cost it demands echoes with each breath I draw. We are playing a dangerous game, where power is the currency and lives are mere tokens.

The Duel Yard was our stage, and the Tharchaeon our judge, a silent specter on her throne. This event—purging weakness—was a spectacle of brutality. The slum dwellers, the Satyrs, the orcs—all fodder in a twisted display of strength. It is a perverse dance that Thayans orchestrate, reveling in chaos, and yet, we must partake.

Our actions were scrutinized, judged not only by our foes but by our allies. Corman, ever the principled, balked at the necessity. A misguided crusader, clinging to ideals in a reality where ideals are a luxury. His disdain for our decisions was palpable, and I wonder if he sees the balance we must strike between power and restraint. “Show hesitation and they see weakness,” I told him, a truth he must learn, lest it be his undoing.

As Gravebreaker swung, cleaving life from body, I felt the surge of magic, the reminder that control must be absolute. To lose oneself is to succumb to the madness of unchecked power. The Tharchaeon's eyes, ever-watching, demand more than simple survival; they demand mastery.

The shade of Corman's judgment is heavy, yet I cannot afford to be swayed by sentiment. There is a cost to war, a cost to survival in this land where mercy is a word without meaning. Though his words of contempt linger, I see them for what they are—a shield against the fear of becoming what he despises.

The Kestris beckons, a contest where the stakes are beyond mere life and death. It is a contest of wills, of strategies, and I must be ready. The Lord’s Alliance plays a hand against Priador, a gamble with everything at stake. Redemption may be a distant echo, but I will not falter. I will remember that power is the means, not the end.
