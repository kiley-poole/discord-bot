Dear Journal,

Today was a real big mess. I think it's hard sometimes, figuring out what's right and what's wrong. We did the Weakness Purge, but it didn't feel right. Eirik and the others killed folks, but they say it's the rules. I don't like those rules. Rules shouldn't make you do bad things. I tried to stop them, but they said it's what we had to do to win. I felt really mad and sad. I don't want to hurt innocent folks.

Then there was the Dark Bargaining. I was real scared. It was like a dream, but not the good kind. I lost my hand, Journal. My left one, just gone. I tried to do what I thought was right. I made an oath, but it was hard to understand the words. I did my best, though. I think Lathander would say I tried my hardest.

Bog and Thalrok were with me. They didn't let me feel alone. We did something good, I think. I hope taking the right souls was good. They went into the hammer, Lathander's Glory. It's special now, I think. It's got a glow. I hope that's good.

I feel mixed up, Journal. Eirik says he did what he had to. But I don't think it's right to hurt kids. I don't trust him or Morty now. They're not like me. But me and Thalrok and Bog, we got through the weird space and did the right thing. I hope I can fix my hand and make things better.

I'm gonna try to keep my head up, do the right thing, and make Lathander proud. I know I can do it. 

Goodnight, Journal.

Corman
