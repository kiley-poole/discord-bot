Dear Booze-Soaked Ramblings,

Well, here we are again, trapped in another episode of hellish lunacy. Quite literally. The fourth layer of hell, Phlegethos, has been our not-so-lovely abode, and let me tell you, it reeks worse than a gnoll with halitosis. But hey, at least the ale here doesn't disappoint.

So, we crashed our ship against a volcano named Timphylos because why not? Apparently, we were on some grand mission to trade succubus blood for treasures. Sounds like a fairytale, right? Only if you enjoy tales about getting screwed over by devils. We met Eric Thorne's buddy, the proprietor, a devil with a name longer than a dragon's tail. He wants artifacts in exchange for trophies from the Thane Games. Honestly, the whole thing reeked of a setup, but here we are, playing along like good little pawns.

Speaking of setups, we almost got conned into a siren's song of sorts. Some dockside establishment tried to lure us in with promises of food and rest. Ha! I don't trust anything that sounds too good to be true, especially in hell. But, of course, my companions fell for it, hook, line, and sinker. Good thing Thalrok had some sense to steer us clear of that disaster.

Then there's the little dance we had to perform for Shankarnarth, the high and mighty reformist. He wanted a performance. Can you believe that? I suppose devils do get bored watching souls writhe in agony all day. Corman suggested some kind of stomp dance, and I just went with the flow, drumming away. Didn't think I'd be doing a jig for the damned today, but here we are.

Oh, and let's not forget the grand finale. Facing off against a beholder called the Reforming Gaze. What a charming fellow, with its eye beams and tentacles. Just the kind of thing to brighten up your day in hell. I'm glowing red for some reason, probably because I fudged the truth a bit. Who knows what that's about, but it doesn't hurt, so I'll roll with it.

We're in deep now, surrounded by devils, dealing with the aftermath of Nitya getting turned into goo, and trying to figure out how to survive another day without becoming devil chow. But I did strike a deal with Timphylos for the destruction of Thay. Revenge is a dish best served hot, after all.

Time to see what this beholder has in store for us. If we survive, maybe then I'll find a drink that's as strong as my disdain for all things hellish. Until then, I'll keep swinging, keep drinking, and keep hoping for a way out of this infernal mess.

Bottoms up,
Bog
