Dear Bottled Regrets,

Another day, another taste of hell. Not the kind I’m used to, mind you, but a different beast altogether. Today we’ve waded through water, ice, and guts of some oversized beastie. You’d think that’d slow us down, but nope—Corman, Eirik, and yours truly decided to play mermaids first, and what a mess that was. The water was colder than a banshee's kiss, and my hooves can only do so much in that wet abyss. Corman, bless his one-handed soul, nearly drowned us with his idea of athletic prowess, but we made it through. Barely. 

Then came the ice. The perfect way to chill my already frozen spirits. Nitya took a fireball to a Yeti—which didn’t quite burn the way we hoped—and Morty did his little dance with the teleportation dagger. We smashed through that like an angry bull in a china shop. At least the icy hell was over quick. Lucky me, right? Two hells down, one to go. 

The life portal shoved us straight into a beast's belly. Talk about being swallowed by your problems. Corman and Thalrok bravely led the way trying to talk to the damn thing like it had feelings. Who knew monster intestines would be so homey? We found a wand lodged in some acid—perfect for Corman to mule over to Nitya. But of course, the walls had to close in, metaphorically. We ran into tentacles, organs, and our fair share of crap before diving headfirst into a monster's rectum. A fitting end, no?

And now I sit, watching the others take on a stormy sea while we wait, drenched and tired. Only one more bout of madness remains before we can claim those obelisks. What a joke. The Thayans think they can break us with their twisted games, but we've faced worse. This circus only adds fuel to my fire.

Damn this place, damn the Red Wizards, and damn me for still being here. At least the ale doesn’t disappoint. Here’s hoping I can drown the memory of today in it before the next hellish trial begins.

Yours in eternal bitterness,
Bog
