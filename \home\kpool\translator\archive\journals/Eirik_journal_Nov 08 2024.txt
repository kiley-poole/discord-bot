Entry:

The morning began with a familiar discipline—calisthenics. A necessary ritual to maintain control over the physical form and, in turn, the chaotic currents of magic swirling within. I felt a semblance of clarity as we stretched beneath the Thayan sun, preparing for whatever lay ahead. Corman's enthusiasm, though sometimes grating, was contagious enough to stir even the most reluctant among us. The sun had not yet reached its apex when we found ourselves drawn into the slums, the oppressive air clinging like a second skin. A visit to Nitya's apartment turned into a confrontation with a man, Frederick, whose greed knows no bounds. I should have seen through his demands, but the focus remains on our objectives. Eldrick, now recovered, has been a beacon of knowledge but also a reminder of our precarious standing in this land of unchecked power. Yet, the day truly began with the monastery—a monument of peace shattered by flames, both literal and arcane. The sight of the salamander creatures, elemental and fierce, ignited a familiar aggression within me. Every swing of Gravebreaker was a dance between power and mastery, a chance to correct the flaws of the past. The heat was suffocating, but the cold determination to overcome eclipsed any discomfort. The jewel, an enigma wrapped in fire, fell into our possession. It sings a different tale to Bog now, one I must remain wary of. Power unchecked is power wasted, but it is also power misunderstood. The day's close found me amidst relics of another world, shared by a wanderer of the natural ways. Gifts bestowed freely, yet burdened with the weight of past lives. The others see opportunity; I see the threads of destiny weaving tighter around us. A glimpse into the future offered by the stargazer reveals chaos—a purple tempest upon the harbor. A stark reminder that time is a fragile construct, easily torn asunder by those who dare to wield it recklessly. I must remember, power is the means, not the end. Control is paramount. As the twilight descends, I find solace in the quiet moments of reflection. The path ahead remains fraught with danger, but I am not alone in this endeavor. The bonds we forge, the actions we take, will determine the course of the coming days. I must remain vigilant, disciplined, and above all, prepared for the trials to come. There is still much to learn, much to atone for. Until then, I write this with a steady hand and a resolute heart.
