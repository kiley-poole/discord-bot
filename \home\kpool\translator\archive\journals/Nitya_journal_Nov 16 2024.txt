Field Report: The Precarious Prelude to Kestris

The day began with a pitiful display from those who fancy themselves heroes. The so-called weakness purge—a misnomer if ever there was one—was little more than a slaughterhouse of morality. The Westerners, led by their self-righteous paladin, Eirik, showed their true colors, indulging in the macabre theater of blood and obedience to the barbaric rules of Thay. Trust is a fool's luxury; these are not the allies one wishes for, but rather the cards fate has dealt. They seem eager to please their Thayan overlords, oblivious to the strings that bind them. 

Corman, the fool, stands on his pedestal of imagined righteousness, quick to judge yet terrified to act. He winces at the truth as if it were an open wound. His naive attempts to rescue the children were noble in intention, but tragically misguided. Sentiment clouds judgment, and I can't afford that. He calls me a monster, unaware of the darkness he himself harbors. He should take solace in the fact that I did what needed to be done—clean, efficient, merciful in its finality. 

Bog, ever the brute, seemed unfocused, caught between the echoes of his own conscience and the task at hand. His performance was adequate, though his heart is too soft for this world. Morty, on the other hand, is a wildcard—a delightful enigma. He executes with precision, his actions unburdened by the weight of morality. A potential asset. Needs further evaluation.

My investigation into the explosion at the Grand Marketplace bore fruit. The device, crude yet devastating, reeks of Thayan circle magic. The Probity Corps knows more than they let on, but my findings have granted me access—a necessary foothold in this den of snakes. The explosion was a glaring statement of Thay's internal discord, a fissure that may yet be exploited.

The day ended with the dark bargaining, where Corman lost more than he gained. His hand—a fitting metaphor for his tenuous grasp on reality—drifts somewhere in the void. A fool’s errand, if ever there was one, and yet, a morbidly amusing spectacle to watch. His oath, hollow as it was, changed nothing. The ghosts that haunt him now are of his own making.

Kestris looms—a game of death masquerading as honor. I stand among allies I neither chose nor trust, preparing to face an enemy with the gall to challenge us so early. An unwise decision, but then, wisdom is a rare commodity in these parts.
