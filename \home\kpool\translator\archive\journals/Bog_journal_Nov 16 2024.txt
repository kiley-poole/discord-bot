Drunken Diary of the Day

Alright, so here's what went down in this hellhole called Thay. Yours truly, Bog, got tossed into a whirlwind of madness with the merry band of misfits I call companions—or morons, depending on the moment. The Thayans, those delightful bastards, decided to put us through another one of their charming little games today. 

First, the Weakness Purge. Well, it was a bloody massacre, plain and simple. They shove a crowd of pitiful souls into the arena, expecting us to turn them into mincemeat. The crowd roared, thirsty for blood, and Eirik, that cold-blooded son of a bitch, was all too eager to oblige. I swear, watching him impale those satyrs was like watching a butcher with a new cleaver. The crowd loved it, but me? I was less than impressed. These games are a sick joke, and the punchline is a pile of corpses.

Corman, bless his misguided heart, had a meltdown over the whole ordeal. He's got this thing about saving innocents—quaint, really. But today, he learned that in Thay, innocence is just a charming myth they sell to children. Nitya, on the other hand, was off playing detective, trying to solve a mystery while the rest of us were neck-deep in gore. Priorities, Nitya. Priorities.

Then there's the Kestris. Oh, the lovely, delightful Kestris. A fight to the death with the lovely folks from Priador. They swaggered into the arena like they owned the place, throwing insults our way. I couldn't care less. They're just another bunch of pompous bastards who think they're better than everyone else. We'll see about that. 

And let's not forget Corman's Dark Bargaining. The bloke lost his hand in some cosmic poker game with a celestial being. Came back with a rock hand and a shiny new mace, looking like he had walked out of a bad fairy tale. Still, he had a certain fire in his eyes, and for a moment, I thought there might be hope for him yet. But then he went back to sulking like a kicked puppy. Who knew losing a hand would make someone so bloody melodramatic?

So here we are, on the cusp of Kestris, with the stakes high and tempers even higher. The Lord's Alliance has got us tangled in a mess that could swallow us whole, and frankly, I'm just here for the ale and the chaos. 

Here's to another day in the infernal pit that is Thay. Cheers to the mess, the chaos, and whatever the hell comes next.

Until next time, you sorry excuse for a diary.
