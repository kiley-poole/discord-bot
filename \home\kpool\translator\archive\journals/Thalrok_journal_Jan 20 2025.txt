Storm's Edge Journal,

Today, the skies spoke of trials, and they did not lie. We faced the Kestris, blood and thunder. The wind whispered danger, and I heeded its call. We fought, and we conquered, yet not unscathed. The storm's fury does not choose sides, and today it tested us all.

The arena echoed with the cries of those who could not be saved—a noise that churned my soul. I carried some from the tempest, but their faces haunt me still. I could not save them all. The storm took them, and I feel the weight of that loss. It clings to me like mist on a mountain.

The relay was next—a challenge of mind and spirit. Each portal a different trial. We swam through dark waters, a beast above us. Cold bit our bones in the ice chamber, yet we pushed on. In the belly of the beast, I shifted, a Hodag's strength to guide my path. Strange, that form. Powerful, yet the rain of acid still stings. 

Through the stormy seas of another realm, I watched my friends fight the waves. Morty, Nitya, and I brace for the final trial. The sea's roar is a familiar song, yet it brings no comfort. I see the clouds gather, and I know this is not the end. We will ride the storm, or we will be broken by it. I feel the pull of the skies calling me home. But not yet. There is work to be done.

I miss my wingmate. The sky was ours, and now it feels hollow without him. I won't fail again. Not this time. I will fight for those who can't fight for themselves. It's what he would have wanted. It's what I must do.

The storm has not yet passed, and my fists are ready. Until the skies clear, I will stand. I will endure. They call it reckless; I call it necessary.

Skyguard's honor,
Thalrok "Skystorm" Stonefist
