**Journal Entry: Day... Who Cares Anymore?**

Ah, the River Styx, what a sight. I found myself afloat on the lava seas of Phlegethos with the merry band of misfits — or, as I like to call them, my potential future vessels. Each one a delightful case study in mortality and, perhaps, an inadvertent benefactor in my quest for eternal life. Today's tally? A soul coin richer and a wee bit more entertained. 

Our journey was a fascinating dance with death and diplomacy. One would think crossing the River Styx would be the highlight of any mortal's existence, but no, not for Morthyros, the undead rogue with a flair for the dramatic. Watching the others cower in fear or make noble sacrifices was particularly amusing. The apprentice's screams still echo delightfully in my undead ears — a melody of mortality meeting its predictable demise.

The crossing lord, with all his infernal charm, was an unexpected delight. A simple deal, a bit of skin here and there, and voilà! A soul coin minted in the heart of hell. A small price for such entertainment, wouldn't you agree? Our human mage, Nitya, also summoned a demon to spice things up a bit. How quaint! The rabble it caused was worth a chuckle, if nothing else. I remind myself, she may serve as an interesting host one day, should her penchant for risky decisions catch up with her.

Of course, there was the matter of the towering pit fiend. Missing a hand, I might add — not that I'm one to judge a fellow for missing parts. Nitya's theatrics nearly provoked a most enjoyable confrontation, only to be interrupted by the boss’s boss’s boss. Asmodeus himself, with words smoother than the finest silk, reminded us of our place in his grand design. A lovely reminder that even the infernal have their own hierarchy and politics.

Our journey has finally brought us to Timphalos, the Mouth of Iron. The birthplace of infernal iron and the very coins we now possess. I must remind myself that my own form, while durable, could always do with an upgrade. Perhaps a new shell forged in the fires of Timphalos? We shall see what the day brings. 

In any case, my list of potential hosts grows more interesting by the day. Should my current form require replacement, I have no shortage of options. For now, I’ll continue to play along, observing the delightful chaos of mortal ambition. After all, life — or unlife — is all about the choices we make, and the bodies we take.

Until the next tally,
Morthyros
