Dear Paper Friend,

Today was a hard day. We jumped in a big water wall. It was so cold, like ice cream but not fun. Eirik, Bog, and me had to swim real fast. It was scary. There was a big shadow fish, or maybe it was a squid. I don’t know. I tried to remember what Lathander said about being brave, so I swam real strong. My arm hurt from the cold, but I didn’t stop. We got to the other side. Eirik used his magic to get us through. He’s smart, but he did something bad to children. I can’t forget that. I don’t know if I can trust him.

Then, we went inside a big monster. It was like a house but gross. There was a lot of squishy stuff. I was with Thalrock and Eirik again. We had to be careful not to step on stuff. The monster’s tummy was big and full of treasure chests. I found a wand, but it burned my hand. It’s gonna be okay.

We had to fight something at the end. It was like a big, yucky worm. I hit it with Lathander’s Glory. I think I did good. Eirik helped too. We worked as a team, even if he is a baddie sometimes. I still don’t know what to think.

Now we wait for Nitya, Morty, and Thalrock to finish. They are in the sea with big waves. I hope they are okay. I don’t want to lose friends, even if Morty is scary. Lathander says to help the small folks, and I will. I must be strong and brave, like he wants me to be.

I’m tired, but I will keep going. There’s more to do. We got to win the games. Lathander is watching.

Your friend,
Corman
