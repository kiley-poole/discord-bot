**Day 6 of the Thayan Games – A Delightful Turn of Events**

Ah, the arena, that splendid theater of chaos and carnage. Today was a rather satisfying spectacle, filled with all the delightfully macabre elements that make life, or the semblance of it, truly worthwhile. The Kestris against Pryador has concluded in our favor, and I find myself quite amused by the proceedings.

*Body Tally Update:*

--- **Eirik, The Human Juggernaut**  
Body Score: 7/10  
The man is a force of nature, bashing heads with abandon and shrugging off damage like a well-seasoned tankard of ale. His body, while not the most graceful, is robust and impressively resilient. A fine candidate if I ever wish to experience sheer brute force. His emotional volatility could be a tad burdensome, but beggars can’t be choosers. Possession Likelihood: Moderate.

--- **Bog, The Perpetual Motion Goat**  
Body Score: 6.5/10  
Despite his brief psychological hiccup, courtesy of our charming Soul Drinker, Bog remains a whirlwind of activity. His leaps and bounds are a marvel to watch, but one must wonder about the state of his knees. Still, his form carries potential, especially for quick escapes. Possession Likelihood: Moderate. 

--- **Corman, The Conflicted Paladin**  
Body Score: 5/10  
Ah, dear Corman. His mind addled by Miranda’s trickery, he remains a cautionary tale of susceptibility. Yet, his body is sturdy enough to withstand a thrashing, and his armor is a delightful bonus. Should I require a vessel more focused on endurance, he might suffice. But his moral quandaries are a bit of a bore. Possession Likelihood: Low, unless in dire need.

*End of Body Tally.*

Miranda’s final act was a symphony of delightful despair. Her attempt to mimic poor Henk’s voice was a masterstroke of psychological torture. I must give her credit: she knew how to leave an impression. Alas, her fate was sealed by the oh-so-convenient “accident” involving Thalrok’s transformation and a conveniently tethered statue. Who knew a giant hornet could be so delightfully creative? 

The arena’s sands now bear witness to our victory, the carcasses of Pryador’s champions scattered like forgotten toys. The Soul Drinker, now a lifeless monument, serves as a grim reminder to all. Truly, a spectacular end to a most entertaining day. 

But I digress. This fleeting triumph means little in the grand scheme. The game marches on, and so must we. As I lay down to rest, I find myself comfortably content, a rare sensation indeed. Perhaps tonight, I’ll ponder the possibilities of my next acquisition—life in a hornet, perhaps? The thought alone is enough to rouse a spectral chuckle.

Until the next dawn of doom,
Morthyros
