Dear Book of Thoughts,

Today was real hard. We was in hell, and it ain't nice here. Lava everywhere, hot like the time I burnt Ma's pie in the oven. We was on a boat called Black Spear, sailing the lava sea. It was scary but I tried to be brave like Lathander wants. I don’t like being scared, but I am sometimes.

We met a big giant man, a fire giant. He was yelling for his lady friend, but he fell in the lava and now he gone. I feel sad for him. I wish I could help. I wanted to be strong like Lathander says, but sometimes I feel real small.

Then we met the devil man, the Whisperer of Pain. Nitya gave him her hair and he liked it. I didn’t understand much, but I know we had to give him stuff to pass. I don’t like giving things to bad people, but we had no choice. 

Then there was a river full of screaming. The Crossing Lord was there, and we had to give him a man’s life. I didn’t like it. He was just a man, even if he was Thayan. Eirik did it, and I was mad. I don’t want to hurt good folks, but we did.

Nitya did a big spell to talk to Asmodeus. I don’t know if it was good. It made the big devil go away, but I was mad at her. I yelled at her. Maybe I shouldn’t have, but I was scared. I wanna be brave like Lathander says, but I don’t know if yelling was right.

I hope I did good. I want to help the little folks. They count on me. I gotta be stronger. Lathander, I hope you hear me. I’m trying my best.

Goodbye for now, Book.

Corman
