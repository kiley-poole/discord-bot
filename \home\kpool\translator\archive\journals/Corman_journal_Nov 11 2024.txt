Dear Book,

Today was a big, big day. We was in the Thayan games and I don't know, lots happened. We went to a burning place and fought some fiery salamanders, and then a druid with spiders tried to sneak on us. It was scary. I was thinking of Lathander the whole time, hoping he'd help me be brave. I tried swinging my sword real strong. 

After, Thalrock wanted to help people escape. He said he had some magic amulet, but it sounded dangerous to me. I want to help folks, but I don't want to get us in trouble. Eirik said it could get us in trouble with the games, and I don't want nothing stopping us from competing. I didn't think of that before. I feel real bad.

Then there was a man and a child. Thalrock said the man had a bomb. I don't know why someone would do that. But then there was a big explosion. I don't understand. Are we the bad guys? I don't know what's right anymore. I keep praying to Lathander. He must know. 

Bog ran fast today. I was so proud. He made us win the Feats of Speed. I gave him a blessing. I hope it helped. Nitya did some magic stuff that made a lady go poof. It was scary. I almost puked. I never seen magic like that before. It was like a sun, but angry. 

I don't know if we're doing the right thing, but I have to try. Lathander says to be brave and help little folks. I hope I am doing good. 

Goodnight, Book.

Corman
