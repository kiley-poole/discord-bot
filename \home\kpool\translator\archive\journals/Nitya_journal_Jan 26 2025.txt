Field Report: Encounter with Demonic Forces in Phlegethos

Our sojourn into hell continues with the routine chaos one might expect of such an endeavor. The oppressive heat of Phlegethos is matched only by the stench of molten rock and the infernal whispers gnawing at the edges of sanity. It's as though we're trespassers in a realm that tolerates us merely as curiosities, specks in the vast, fiery expanse. 

The voyage across the lava sea was interrupted by an incursion of demons—unsurprising, given the summoning I performed not long ago. The fiends clearly harbored a vendetta, especially Shodak, who, with his duplicitous gaze, sought vengeance for our previous encounter. Predictable. Demons never forget, especially when slighted in their own realm.

Corman, in his zealotry, shone like a beacon of Lathander's delusion, scattering the flying demons with an impressive, albeit desperate, display of divine light. His fervor is commendable, though his understanding of infernal politics remains woefully naïve. Nevertheless, it served its purpose, and the demons retreated, blinded by righteous fury.

Thalrok's manipulation of the gusting winds was an unexpected boon. The mountain man has more cunning than his demeanor suggests, harnessing the tempest to fling our adversaries into the consuming embrace of the lava. A fitting end for creatures born of chaos.

The apprentices, though green and terrified, wielded their magic with respectable competence. Still, their loyalty to me wavers under pressure. A lesson they will learn in time: autonomy is a double-edged sword, especially in the Hells.

Their craft finally subdued, the demons withdrew, leaving us to ponder the implications of this attack. The abyssal and infernal do not mix lightly; our presence here has stirred a pot best left simmering.

The path forward remains treacherous, fraught with both the known and the unspeakable. We journey onward to the Mouth of Iron with only a tenuous grasp of our purpose and a certainty that this hellish landscape wishes nothing but our demise.

Trust is a fool’s luxury; sentiment clouds judgment, and I can't afford that. Here, in the depths of hell, our resolve must be ironclad, and our intentions, unyielding. Failure to maintain control is not an option—none can afford to falter when the stakes are eternal damnation.
