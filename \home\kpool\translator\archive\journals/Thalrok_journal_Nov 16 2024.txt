The sky called to me today.

As I stood at the edge of Lesvath, the storm within raged as fiercely as those above the peaks of my homeland. The winds whispered tales of battle, of choices hard as stone, yet I find myself caught between earth and sky, bound by the weight of my past and the duty of my present.

The games test us all, push us past the limits we thought we had. But it is not just strength we learn here. It's the nature of our souls they pry at, the strength of our hearts. The Weakness Purge showed that, I guess. I didn't strike, but I watched. Eirik and Morty did what had to be done, their faces set against the storm of doubt. I wonder if Henk would have done the same.

Corman's heart bled today. His anger was a tempest, and I saw the storm in his eyes. He lost a hand to the dark bargaining, but I see more weight on his shoulders than just that. We walked together, Bog, him, and I. The place was a void of stars, a sky without wind. Corman, he tried so hard, reached for the light, but the cost was high. His heart was true, though. I saw it. I felt it in the air.

Bog stood by us. His silence spoke louder than thunder. The weight of what we did lingered, but we carried the souls back in Lathander's Glory. Maybe we saved some today. Maybe we didn't. The skies don't always give answers.

The Kestris awaits, and I feel the storm grow stronger. Pryador stands across the field, their words as biting as frost. Miranda taunted me, spoke of Henk, but sheâ€™ll see. He still fights with us. The wind carries his voice, a reminder of the oath I took. To protect, to stand by my tribe, my friends. I won't fail again.

The wind tells me to prepare, to stand firm. The battle's coming, and I feel the storm in my bones. We are more than what Thay sees, more than the sum of our strengths and weaknesses. We are the sky's fury and the mountain's resolve.

I'll stop for today. The storm calls again, and I must listen. I won't fail. Not this time.
