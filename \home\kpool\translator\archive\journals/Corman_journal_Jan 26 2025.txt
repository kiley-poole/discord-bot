Dear Journal,

Today was busy. We went to the Thane Games, and it was hard. We got third place. I was mad. I yelled "FUCK!" real loud. I don't like losing. I want to do better for the Lord's Alliance. They are counting on me, and I want to make Lathander proud.

We went on a boat in the lava sea. The lava is hot, really hot. It was scary, and my friends and I wore weird suits. They felt funny, like wearing meat. I don't like it much. We saw things in the sky, and I tried to talk to them, but they didn't listen. I used my light from Lathander, and they got scared. That was good. I felt strong and brave.

Then more bad guys came. They were demons. I didn't know them, but they seemed mad at Nitya. Thalrok blew them away with wind. He is strong. Nitya was sad. The boat was hard to drive. I tried to help but didn't know how. I want to learn more. 

Bog pushed a man off the boat. That was scary. I didn't like it, but Bog said it was okay. I hope we did good. Morty helped too. He is smart.

We must keep going. We have to find Shinkernarth and do what the proprietor asked. I hope we can be back in time for the games. I want to win for the Lord's Alliance. I want to do good. 

I pray to Lathander to help me be strong and brave. 

Goodnight, Journal.
