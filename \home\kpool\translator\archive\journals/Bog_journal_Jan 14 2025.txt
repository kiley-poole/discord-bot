Dearest Barrel of Sorrows,

Well, well, well. Where do I even start with the circus of buffoonery that was today's Kestris? We found ourselves squaring off against the Pryador Thark, and what a collection of dimwits and delusional spell-slingers they turned out to be. Watching Lysia Moonshadow think she could prance about like some celestial ballerina was downright laughable. Thank the gods Morty clipped her wings, or we'd still be here listening to her airy fairy nonsense.

But, of course, the pièce de résistance was that infernal succubus, Miranda. All smug, sitting pretty after yielding like the coward she is. If I had a coin for every smirk that twisted her face, I'd buy out every tavern from here to Waterdeep. I can still hear her trying to mess with Corman's head, playing Henk's voice like a bard at a funeral. Pathetic. There's a special place in the abyss for scum like her. Her grin was wiped clean when Thalrok oh-so-accidentally dropped our new piece of modern art—Soul Drinker the statue—right on her.

Speaking of the Soul Drinker, I can't help but laugh at the irony of him being turned into a stone monument. Who's drinking whose soul now, huh? The others seemed keen on dragging his rocky remains back to Nitya's flat. Quite the interior decoration if you ask me—hell, it's better than her last attempt with those hideous drapes.

And then there's Corman, blessed with the gift of denial as always. He's still clinging to hope for poor, crispy Henk. Maybe his brain took a few too many knocks today. Let's see if he ever wakes up from his delusions.

For all the chaos and the frost nipping at my nips, there's a small flicker of satisfaction that we came out on top. No thanks to my fists being as useful as wet towel half the time. But hey, what are friends for if not to clean up your mess? Eirik and Morty, with their unwavering need to be the last men standing, pulled us through.

So, here's to surviving another day in the madhouse that is Lesbeth. Hope the ale's still flowing, because spirits know I need it after today. Until next time, dear cask of liquid comforts.

Cheers to chaos,
Bog
