Entry,

The events of this day linger in my mind as shadows in the twilight. The Kestris was our proving ground, a contest of both martial skill and arcane prowess against the Pryador Thark. Each decision, each movement in the arena, demanded a precise calculation—a single misstep could mean disaster.

The succubus Miranda, her treacherous allure cloaked in magic, reminded me of the ever-present threat that power unchecked holds. Her manipulation of Corman, twisting his will against his allies, served as a bitter reminder of my own past failures. Yet, it was a lesson too, one I must not forget: the necessity of vigilance against the seduction of power. The Thayans play their twisted games, but they're blind to the consequences. They overreach.

The battle was fierce, each opponent a test of our resolve. Vortac Greyvale's refusal to yield, even in the face of certain defeat, echoes a stubbornness I know all too well—one I must guard against. It was satisfying to see him fall under the weight of his own arrogance, a testament to the folly of reckless ambition.

The fall of Lysia Moonshadow, shot from the sky by Morthyros, was a small victory, yet it brought little comfort. The Soul Drinker, now a stone effigy, stands as a grim reminder of the cost of our struggles. Bog's attempts to claim a trophy from its remains were met with the cold reality of stone. Control and mastery: my mantra in the face of chaos. Miranda's end, crushed under the weight of her own ally’s petrified form, was an unexpected outcome. It was not the path of honor, but it was fitting. Her laughter, even in defeat, was a mockery—one I will not soon forget.

Corman's denial, his refusal to accept the fate of Henk, mirrors my own inner conflict—my guilt, my need for redemption. I must remain steadfast, for in discipline lies salvation. I must remember, power is the means, not the end. I cannot allow the past to dictate my future. One wrong step, one foolish oversight... Never again.

Tonight, I rest, but not without caution. The Thayan Games are but a fleeting diversion in a world fraught with peril. We stand on the precipice of greater challenges, and I must be ready. Every spell cast is a chance to correct the flaws within. Each battle, a lesson learned. I will master the forces within me and those that stand against us.

Until the next encounter,

Eirik Thorne
