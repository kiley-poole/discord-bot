Sky Journal,

The skies spoke of chaos today. Our journey took us across the fiery seas of Phlegethos, and I felt the storm within me. The lava waves were relentless, but we held steady. I bent my will to guide the Black Spear, but the wind whispered of mistakes. We stumbled, the hull groaned—my fault. I’ll patch it. Can’t let her sink.

We met devils, souls in torment, and a giant in despair. His wails were like thunder, lost in anguish. Could’ve been me once. Lost someone too. The mist cleared, but not without cost. Morty’s acts, grim but necessary. Blood for passage. Soul for a coin. The price of the river.

Nitya’s words were like lightning—bold, dangerous. She called on Asmodeus. The air grew thick with his voice. Even the mighty quaked. The devil fled, its wings beating a retreat. A storm avoided, thanks to her defiance. But Corman, he shook like a leaf, angered by what could’ve been. Fears unchecked.

Bog holds the claw. The past returns in pieces. Even without its hand, the fiend loomed large. It’s gone for now, but the skies don’t forget. We sail on, the journey not yet done. I won’t fail again. Not this time.

We reached Tempelos at last. The mouth of the iron waits. The storm clouds gather, but we’ll weather them. The skies know my wrath. I’ll hold fast to my vow—protect them all, honor regained. The past is a shadow I’ll outfly.

The storm called to me today. I answered. We press forward, no shadows will hold us back.
