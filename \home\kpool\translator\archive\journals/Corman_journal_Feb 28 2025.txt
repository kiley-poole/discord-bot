Dear Journal,

Today was real crazy. We was on our boat in the lava sea, and them foreign guys got real mad. Thalrock turned into a big ol' beast and tossed one off the side. Eirik did some fancy moves and Morty did his dagger thing. I tried to help, too. I think I did okay.

I still miss Nitya. She got turned into goo, and nobody seems to care much. Eirik made a deal with them devils, and now he's all happy about it. I don't know if I trust him or that Vaeleth guy. They was talking 'bout some old place called Mythdranor. I don't know what that is, but it seems important to Eirik.

We got to some big place called the reformatory. Met a big scary devil named Shankernath. He wants a performance. I thought maybe we could do a stomp dance or something, but then he said it's a fight to the death. Now there's a big eyeball monster floating in front of us. I don't know if I'm ready for this, but I gotta be brave for the folks counting on us. Lathander wants us to protect the little folks, and I gotta try my best. I hope I don't mess up. I got my hand back, but it feels weird. I don't know what it means.

I'm scared, but I gotta be strong. I hope we can get out of here soon. Henk's still out there, and maybe Nitya too. I won't forget.

Yours truly, Corman
