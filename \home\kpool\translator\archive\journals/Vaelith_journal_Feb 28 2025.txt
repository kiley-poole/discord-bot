**Entry for the Day of the Crimson Sun, Year Unknown**

The air here in Phlegethos, thick with sulfur and the bitter taste of despair, is far removed from the sylvan breezes of Cormanthyr. Yet, within this infernal realm, I find a strange semblance of purpose—a tether to what remains of my fractured existence. Today, the fates conspired to cast me in the path of mortals—odd allies adrift in a web of hellish politics.

Their presence is an unexpected salve to my spirit, though it is tinged with the bitterness of truth. Myth Drannor, my once-vibrant home, lies in ruin, a specter of memory buried beneath centuries of dust and conflict. The Weeping War, a tale now etched in the annals of history, was but a heartbeat ago for me. Yet, these mortals speak of it as one might speak of forgotten legends. Their words strike me with a pang of sorrow—a reminder of all that time has stolen.

The mortals, disparate in their goals yet united in purpose, stand resilient against this realm’s machinations. Their leader, Eirik, wields an artifact that sings with the echoes of the Mythil. It is a relic of my past—a shard of the glory that was Cormanthyr. In his hands, it is both a weapon and a beacon, a testament to the enduring light of our legacy.

As the reformatory's stone doors crumbled to dust, we were met with the enigmatic gaze of Shenkernarth, a devil whose intentions are as murky as the lava seas. The performance he demands of us—a macabre dance for our lives—feels both a mockery and a test. Yet, in this moment, I am reminded of the battles of old, of the valor that once coursed through our veins.

The mortals stand ready, their resolve a flickering flame against the encroaching darkness. I am drawn to their tenacity, their willingness to forge ahead despite the shadows that loom. In them, I see a reflection of the warriors of Cormanthyr—undaunted, unyielding.

Though the world I knew has crumbled, in this raw, untamed age, I find a flicker of hope—a chance to reclaim a measure of what was lost. The weight of the past bears heavily upon me, yet it is this weight that propels me forward. A soldier must endure, adapt, continue—such is the creed of the Akh’Velahr. And so, I march onward, heart tempered by resolve, spirit alight with the embers of memory.
