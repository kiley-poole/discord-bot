**Field Report: The Dance with Devils**

In the business of Hell, time loses its meaning—a dance of days, weeks, or perhaps mere hours. The infernal seas of Phlegethos continue to test our resolve, pushing us ashore at Timphylos. The proprietors of this land, dealing in succubus blood and treasures untold, operate under their own brand of infernal law. A pit stop was all we intended, yet here we are, entangled in negotiations with devils, caught in the web of the reformatory. Trust is a fool's luxury, I reminded myself as Corman, the fool, thrust the trade writ upon me, demanding my silver tongue smooth over the transgressions of our journey.

The air here is thick with sulfur and betrayal, leaving no room for sentiment. It is business, pure and simple, or so I told myself. Corman, in his anger and shortsightedness, forgets that in this wretched place, even anger is currency. I have learned to navigate the abyss with a critical eye, yet even I must tread cautiously. Sentiment clouds judgment, and I can't afford that. Yet, in a moment of folly, I find myself speaking the unspeakable. The words are barely out before the walls of this damned estate close in.

There is no redemption here, only retribution. The infernal court of Timphalos has spoken—my soul is forfeit. For a moment, I saw the truth, the hard truth, in the eyes of the archdevil himself. My armor is breached, my fate sealed within a coin. The Nine Hells taught me that fear is a weakness; now, it seems, I am the lesson. Henk's alive, an irony in my final whisper. I hope they remember. In the end, the abyss consumes all. 

End Report.
