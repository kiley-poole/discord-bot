Entry:

The day has been long, as the sun sets on the horizon of Lesvath. Shadows stretch across the desolate expanse, a reflection of the chaos that has engulfed this place. The Thayan games continue, yet their grandeur is marred by the echoes of tragedy. The explosion in the marketplace—foreseen, yet unprevented—hangs heavy on my conscience. The telescope's vision was not just a warning, but a stark reminder of the uncontrollable nature of power when wielded without restraint. 

"Power unchecked is power wasted," I write, the words a mantra against the recklessness I despise. The incident reaffirms my belief—discipline is paramount. Our actions, no matter how calculated, can spiral into unintended consequences. The Probity Corps' intervention today was a reminder of that reality. Transported to an unknown chamber, I faced the Tharkion's scrutiny. The sensation was disconcerting—falling yet rooted to the spot. Their inquiries, though veiled, sought to unearth our involvement. But I remain resolute—we had nothing to do with the detonation.

In the games, Bog claimed victory in the feats of speed, his nimbleness outmatching the other competitors. Nitya, in the arcane duel, displayed prowess against the Thayan adversary, her spells a deadly dance of lightning and acid. There is merit to our camaraderie, a force that binds us despite the shadows looming over us. Yet, beneath the surface, I sense the discord—the potential for implosion, much like the explosion that gutted the marketplace.

My thoughts drift to Val, Tharkion of this realm. Her enigmatic presence draws me, and Nitya, into her orbit. The sigil she shared promises knowledge—a mastery over the threads of fate. I am tempted by this offering, yet wary of its implications. To navigate this path demands precision and resolve.

The games are a façade, a spectacle hiding the tumult within Thay. The power dynamics at play are fraught with peril. We stand at a precipice, our fates entwined with forces that could either consume or elevate us. The balance is delicate, and I must tread carefully.

The night deepens, and as I close this entry, I am reminded of the journey ahead—a journey towards mastery, redemption, and understanding. We walk a fine line between control and chaos, and I am determined to see the dawn of a day where our past mistakes no longer haunt us.

"One wrong step, one foolish oversight... Never again."
