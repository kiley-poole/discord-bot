**Day 5: The Dance of Death – Body Tally Update**

Ah, the delightful chaos of the Kestris. Truly, there's no spectacle quite like watching mortals frolic in the dance of death, and today—oh today—did not disappoint. Another vivid reminder of the impermanence of life, yet simultaneously a testament to its extraordinary persistence. Let’s indulge in my observations and update the body tally, shall we?

--- 

**Corman, the One-Handed Hero**  
Body Score: 6/10  
A fascinating display, our dear Corman, in his quest to weave oaths from thin air, managed to misplace a hand. Truly, a marvelous misstep. The absence of a hand—well, it makes him a tad less appealing, but there's still a charm to his determination. Perhaps I could consider him if a more noble sacrifice is required. Possession Likelihood: Moderate. He’s got spirit (and now some spirits in his mace), but let’s hope his other hand remains attached.

**Nitya, the Alchemist of Melancholy**  
Body Score: 7/10  
Her spell of acid—it’s a thing of beauty, melting away the weakness of her neighbors with artistry. I've always appreciated a mortal who embraces the reality of decay and dissolution. Her body remains quite intact, and her mind—deliciously pragmatic. Possession Likelihood: High. She knows the value of impermanence.

**Eirik, the Reluctant Butcher**  
Body Score: 7.5/10  
Eirik, oh Eirik, wrestling with the game’s rules as if morality were a cloak to be donned and doffed. There’s something thrilling in his struggle, a dance of denial, as he wields Gravebreaker with grim acceptance. His conscience might be heavy, but his form is robust. Possession Likelihood: High. He’s a masterpiece in conflict—strong, yet torn.

---

**Bog, the Bewildered Beast**  
Body Score: 5/10  
Ah, Bog, the reluctant destroyer. His strength is unquestionable, but his purpose—oh, so muddled. Watching him grapple with his chaotic kind was like observing a child lost in the wilderness. His body might serve as a fortress, but his mind—fragile. Possession Likelihood: Low. A pitiful enigma, this one.

---

**Thalrok, the Silent Storm**  
Body Score: 6.5/10  
A majestic creature, Thalrok, as always. His transformations are a sight to behold. Yet, beneath that serenity lies a storm of guilt and resolve. I adore the balance he maintains, even if it’s precarious. Possession Likelihood: Moderate. If I require a form with wings, he stands as a contender.

The dance continues, and with each step, the bodies around me reveal their secrets. Mortals, with their fleeting vigor, remain unaware of the true inevitability of it all. But I, Morthyros, shall not be caught unprepared. The Weakness Purge, the Dark Bargaining—each a chapter in the book of death. And now, Kestris awaits. What a delight it shall be. 

Until the next purge,  
Morthyros
