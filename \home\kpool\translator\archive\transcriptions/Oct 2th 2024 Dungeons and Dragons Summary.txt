The Thayan Games had not been kind to the party, but they pressed on, determined to defend the altar at all costs. The first wave had been brutal—massive red apes hurling bombs and wreaking havoc—but the group had managed to fend them off. Now, with the altar damaged but still standing, they faced a new threat: the scavengers of the battlefield. The arena gates creaked open, and from the shadows emerged a swarm of baseball-sized fleas, their tiny forms moving like a tide over the arena floor. Along with them came other beasts, twisted and exotic, eager to feast on the remains of the battle.

Nitya, the human wizard, moved quickly. She rifled through her pack, her fingers finding the gilded skull she had been saving for a moment like this. Holding it aloft, she chanted the words of summoning: "Hum-da, hum-da, hum-da." The air around her shimmered with dark energy, and from the ground rose a putrid undead spirit, its form dripping with festering ooze. She directed it toward the swarm of fleas, sending the creature lurching forward, its rotting claws outstretched.

The fleas, undeterred, surged toward the undead, crawling over its decaying form. Their bites, though small, began to desiccate the creature, drawing what little life remained from its festering body. Nitya grimaced, knowing that the undead would not hold for long against such numbers, but it would at least buy them some time.

Eirik, standing near the altar, brushed off his maul, Gravebreaker, and stepped forward. His eyes locked onto two of the larger beasts approaching from the west. With a roar, he taunted them, hoping to draw their attention. He planted himself firmly on the stairs in front of Nitya, readying his weapon for the first creature that dared to come close. His muscles tensed, prepared to strike with all his might.

Above them, Corman, the human paladin, remained mounted on Thalrok, who had taken the form of a massive hornet. The two had developed a strategy during the first wave—Corman riding atop the druid’s back, using a ballista to rain down destruction from the skies. It had worked before, and they hoped it would work again. Corman shifted his position, trying to get comfortable as he aimed the ballista at the largest creature he could see to the west. His first shot went wide, but with a second try, the weapon responded, launching a harpoon of crackling lightning toward a massive goo-like creature that was slowly rolling toward them.

The bolt struck true, and the goo creature shuddered, its form rippling as the lightning coursed through its body. Corman grinned, slapping the side of Thalrok’s hornet form. "Forward, onward, charge!" he bellowed, his voice filled with excitement. They were still in the fight.

The arena crowd roared in approval, their bloodthirsty cheers filling the air. The Thayan Games were meant to be a spectacle, and the party was delivering. But the creatures they faced were relentless. A massive parrot-like beast, its feathers bristling with fury, took to the skies, its eyes locked onto Thalrok. It let out a guttural roar, challenging the druid in his hornet form, and began to close the distance, its wings beating furiously as it ascended higher into the air.

Meanwhile, the goo creature continued its slow advance. It moved like a living blob, folding in on itself as it rolled across the sand. The sound of clanging metal echoed from within its form, as if it had consumed weapons and armor from fallen warriors, now rusting and useless within its gelatinous body. As it approached, the party could hear the sickening squelch of its movement, a reminder of the horrors they faced in this twisted arena.

Bog, the satyr monk, stood near the altar, his hooves shifting on the sand as he eyed the approaching threats. He had seen many strange things in his time, but a swarm of bloodthirsty fleas and a living blob of metal and goo were new even for him. He readied himself, his fists clenched, waiting for the right moment to strike.

The battle was far from over. The scavengers of the battlefield were closing in, and the party knew they would need to rely on each other if they were to survive the second wave. The altar, though damaged, was still standing, and as long as they could protect it, there was hope. But the Thayan Games were unforgiving, and the creatures they faced were unlike anything they had ever seen before.

With the crowd’s cheers echoing in their ears, the party steeled themselves for the fight ahead. They had come too far to fail now.

The arena was a cacophony of chaos, as the party struggled to defend the altar against the relentless waves of bizarre and deadly creatures. Bog, the satyr monk, had initially set his sights on the swarm of fleas that scuttled across the battlefield, but the sight of Nitya’s summoned undead being overwhelmed by the tiny creatures gave him pause. He hesitated, realizing that charging into the swarm might not be his best course of action. Instead, his eyes fell upon a strange, armored creature resembling a groundhog, but covered in vicious, serrated scales. 

Without wasting time, Bog sprinted toward the pangolin-like beast, his hooves kicking up sand as he closed the distance. His fists flew, striking the creature with precision, but the moment his knuckles connected with its thorny hide, pain shot through his arms. The creature’s scales were sharp enough to cut into him with every blow, and Bog gritted his teeth as he felt the sting of his own attacks being turned against him. The pangolin’s natural defense was formidable, and Bog quickly realized that each strike would cost him dearly.

Cursing under his breath, Bog threw another punch, unwilling to retreat despite the pain. His fists slammed into the creature again, but the backlash from its spines was brutal. His skin tore, and blood dripped from his knuckles. "Damn it," he muttered, hunkering down, knowing he couldn’t keep this up for long. He needed a moment to recover, to gather his strength, but there was no time for respite in the heat of battle.

Meanwhile, high above the battlefield, Thalrok, the goliath druid, soared through the sky in his hornet form, with Corman, the human paladin, clinging to his back. They had perfected this strategy during the earlier waves, with Corman using the ballista mounted on Thalrok’s back to rain down destruction from above. But as Thalrok dived toward the battlefield, banking sharply to avoid a rolling ooze creature, Corman lost his grip. The paladin tumbled from the druid’s back, hitting the ground with a heavy thud.

Corman groaned as he rolled to his feet, dusting himself off. The fall had been rough, but he was unharmed. His ballista, however, had fallen a few feet away, leaving him momentarily without his weapon. "Well, that could’ve gone better," he muttered, shaking his head. Thalrok, now circling back toward the altar, hovered ten feet above the ground, ready to swoop down for another attack.

On the far side of the arena, a new threat emerged. A massive, undead creature, its body wreathed in smoke and fire, lumbered forward. Its very presence seemed to choke the air with thick, acrid smoke, and as it approached Eirik, the human fighter, it unleashed a pyroclastic breath, a wave of molten ash and smoke that engulfed him. Eirik, though momentarily overwhelmed, stood his ground, his muscles straining as he resisted the suffocating cloud. The smoke swirled around him, but he refused to be brought down by it.

Back at the altar, Bog’s battle with the pangolin continued. The creature, sensing an opportunity, lashed out with its tail and claws, striking Bog with brutal force. The satyr grunted in pain, his body battered by the creature’s relentless assault. He had already used his reaction to heal himself, and now he found himself on the defensive, struggling to keep up with the pangolin’s relentless strikes. 

Suddenly, the creature curled into a tight ball, its spiny hide bristling with deadly edges, and began to roll away. Bog, panting and bloodied, watched it go, knowing that any attempt to strike it as it fled would only result in more pain for himself. He let it go, unwilling to risk further injury.

As the pangolin retreated, a new horror floated above the battlefield. A massive, jellyfish-like creature, its body pulsating with eerie light, hovered above the swarm of fleas. Long, sinuous tentacles unfurled from its body, reaching down to pluck the fleas from the ground. One by one, the tiny creatures were lifted into the air, disappearing into the creature’s maw as it fed. The swarm, which had been a significant threat just moments before, was quickly consumed, leaving only the floating jellyfish drifting lazily toward the center of the battlefield.

Nitya, the human wizard, stood near the altar, her eyes darting between the various threats. She had seen creatures like the massive parrot-beast, the Wok Wok, before in her travels to Kalimport, and she knew they could be easily intimidated. Flipping through her spellbook, she found a spell she hoped would frighten the creature, but as she began to chant, she realized her mistake. The Wok Wok, with a graceful twist of its wings, dodged her firebolt with ease, its feathers shimmering in the sunlight.

Frustrated, Nitya turned her attention back to her putrid undead spirit. "Go," she commanded, her voice sharp. The creature lurched forward once again, its rotting form dripping with decay as it moved toward the remaining fleas. The fleas, already weakened by the jellyfish’s attack, were no match for the undead’s poisonous aura, and they began to wither and die as they came into contact with it.

As the battle raged on, the party found themselves surrounded by strange and deadly creatures, each more dangerous than the last. The altar still stood, but for how much longer? The Thayan Games were unforgiving, and the next wave could be their last. But the party had faced impossible odds before, and they would face them again, together.

The arena was a maelstrom of chaos, the crowd’s deafening cheers mixing with the cacophony of battle. Corman, still reeling from his fall off Thalrok’s back, struggled to get to his feet. Fleas the size of a man’s fist crawled over his armor, their tiny, piercing proboscises finding every gap in his plate to draw blood. He groaned, feeling the sting of their bites, his blood seeping into the sand beneath him. 

Memories of a time long past flashed in his mind—a young boy falling from a horse near Amphale, the sting of failure and the weight of his own inadequacy pressing down on him. But this was no time for reflection. Gritting his teeth, Corman forced himself up and called upon the divine power of Lathander. His hands glowed with a soft, golden light as he laid them upon his chest, the healing magic surging through his body, knitting his wounds and restoring his strength. He emptied his reserves, feeling the warmth of his god’s blessing fill him completely.

Still, the fleas clung to him, their tiny forms relentless. With a frustrated growl, Corman raised his longsword and swung, calling upon the divine power of his faith. "Lathander, guide my blade!" he whispered, invoking a Divine Smite. His sword glowed with radiant energy as it cleaved through the swarm, but the fleas were too small, too numerous. His blade only caught a few of them, their tiny bodies bursting with light as they disintegrated, but the majority remained, still biting, still draining his strength. 

Nearby, Thalrok, still in his hornet form, buzzed through the air, his massive wings beating furiously. The Wok Wok, the enormous parrot-like beast, had taken to the skies once more, its guttural calls echoing through the arena as it zeroed in on the druid. The creature’s beak lashed out, catching Thalrok in the side. The goliath druid winced, but his concentration held, the storm clouds he had summoned still swirling above them. With a flash of lightning, the clouds roared to life, and a bolt of pure energy shot down from the heavens, striking the battlefield below. It barely grazed one of the floating tentacles of the strange jellyfish creature, singeing it but doing little more than angering the beast.

Below, Eirik, standing tall with Gravebreaker in hand, faced down the massive smoke-wreathed zombie. The creature loomed before him, its body crackling with embers, the air around it thick with choking ash. With a roar, Eirik swung Gravebreaker, the massive maul crashing into the beast’s chest. The impact sent a shockwave through the arena, and the zombie staggered, falling to the ground with a heavy thud, embers scattering like fireflies. 

But the creature was not yet defeated. As it lay prone, its body still smoldering, Eirik brought Gravebreaker down again, aiming for its chest. The maul connected, but the damage was minimal. The smoke and ash seemed to absorb much of the force, and the creature, though weakened, remained a threat. 

On the far side of the arena, Bog, the satyr monk, stood amidst the chaos, his fists still aching from his earlier encounter with the spiny pangolin. He had watched as the creature rolled itself into a tight ball, its serrated scales protecting it from the swarm of fleas that had tried to envelop it. Now, with no immediate target in sight, Bog’s eyes darted around, searching for his next move. 

"How high is that thing?" he muttered to himself, eyeing the floating jellyfish creature. It hovered about fifteen feet in the air, its tentacles lazily drifting down toward the battlefield. Bog’s muscles tensed, his body coiled like a spring. He could leap, he thought. He could reach it. 

But before he could act, the ooze creature, a massive blob of gelatinous horror, began to move. Its form shifted and rolled, enveloping one of the swarms of fleas that had been crawling toward Corman. The fleas disappeared into the ooze, their tiny bodies dissolving within its acidic form. The creature continued its slow advance, its sights set on Corman, who was still struggling to fend off the remaining fleas.

Corman, sensing the danger, tried to dodge as the ooze rolled toward him. He managed to avoid the first wave, but the creature was relentless, its amorphous body shifting and expanding, threatening to engulf him entirely. The paladin braced himself, knowing that if the creature caught him, it would be nearly impossible to escape.

Meanwhile, Nitya, the wizard, stood near the altar, her mind racing as she surveyed the battlefield. Her putrid undead servant had managed to catch a few of the fleas in its poisonous aura, but the swarm was still a threat. She flipped through her spellbook, searching for something—anything—that could turn the tide. Her eyes fell on a familiar incantation, and with a flick of her wrist, she sent a firebolt streaking toward the Wok Wok. 

But the massive bird was too quick. With a graceful twist of its wings, it dodged the spell, the firebolt dissipating harmlessly in the air. Frustrated, Nitya turned her attention back to the ground, her mind racing for a new plan.

The battle raged on, each member of the party locked in their own desperate struggle. The altar still stood, but for how much longer? The creatures of the Thayan Games were relentless, and the next wave could be their undoing. Yet, despite the overwhelming odds, the party fought on, bound by their determination to survive and protect the altar at all costs.

The battle in the Thayan arena raged on, each member of the party locked in a desperate struggle for survival. Bog, the satyr monk, had been sprinting across the battlefield, trying to assist his comrades, when disaster struck. As he darted beneath the massive dust grazer—a creature hovering in the air like a grotesque jellyfish—one of its long, sinuous tentacles lashed out, wrapping around his waist with a vice-like grip. The creature’s intent was clear: it aimed to pull him into its maw, where he would surely meet a grisly end.

Bog grunted as the tentacle constricted around him, the pressure threatening to crush his ribs. He could feel his hooves starting to slip in the sand as the creature began to reel him in. But the satyr was nothing if not resourceful. Gritting his teeth, he twisted his body, using his agility to slip free from the tentacle’s grasp. With a final, desperate lunge, he broke away, landing a few feet from the creature. He had no time to celebrate his escape, however, as the battlefield was still teeming with threats.

Without missing a beat, Bog launched into a flurry of blows, his fists striking out like lightning. His target was the smoldering zombie that Eirik had been battling—a massive creature wreathed in smoke, its body still crackling with embers. Bog’s fists connected with the creature’s chest, each strike sending shockwaves through its decayed form. The zombie staggered, but it remained standing, its charred body still a threat. With a final, powerful punch, Bog disengaged, retreating back toward the altar to reassess the situation.

Across the battlefield, Thalrok, the goliath druid, was locked in an aerial duel with the Wok Wok, a massive parrot-like beast that had been terrorizing the skies. Thalrok, still in his hornet form, banked sharply to avoid another strike from the bird’s beak. The Wok Wok screeched in frustration as it missed its mark, its wings beating furiously as it tried to catch up to the druid. But Thalrok had other plans. With a sudden burst of speed, he swooped down toward the ground, pulling up just in time to avoid the dust grazer’s tentacles. The Wok Wok, unable to match his maneuver, flew right past him, leaving itself vulnerable.

Seizing the opportunity, Thalrok called upon the storm clouds he had summoned earlier. With a flash of lightning, a bolt shot down from the heavens, striking the battlefield below. The lightning arced through the air, catching not only the Wok Wok but also a few of the fleas that had been scuttling across the sand. The tiny creatures exploded in a series of pops, their bodies disintegrating as the electricity coursed through them.

Meanwhile, Corman, the human paladin, found himself in a dire situation. After being unceremoniously thrown from Thalrok’s back earlier in the battle, he had been struggling to fend off a swarm of fleas that had latched onto him. Their bites were relentless, and he could feel his strength slowly draining as they continued to feed. But Corman was not one to give up easily. Calling upon the divine power of Lathander, he laid his hands upon his chest, channeling healing energy into his body. The warmth of his god’s blessing filled him, knitting his wounds and restoring his vitality. 

Still, the fleas clung to him, their tiny forms too numerous to dispatch with a single blow. With a frustrated growl, Corman swung his longsword, invoking a Divine Smite. His blade glowed with radiant energy as it cut through the swarm, sending bursts of light through the arena. A few of the fleas disintegrated, but the majority remained, still biting, still draining his strength. To make matters worse, the massive ooze creature that had been slowly advancing across the battlefield was now rolling toward him, its gelatinous form threatening to engulf him entirely.

At the altar, Nitya, the human wizard, stood with her spellbook in hand, her eyes darting between the various threats. The Wok Wok had been a thorn in their side for too long, and she decided it was time to deal with it. Stepping forward, she raised her hands, channeling a spell she had learned long ago. With a sharp cry, she unleashed a blast of burning hands, sending a wave of fire toward the massive bird.

The flames engulfed the Wok Wok, its feathers lighting up like dry tinder. The creature screeched in pain, its once-majestic plumage now singed and charred. It flapped its wings desperately, trying to put out the flames, but the damage had been done. Nitya smirked as she watched the creature falter in the air, its movements sluggish and erratic.

Not content with just one victory, Nitya turned her attention to the swarm of fleas that still plagued the battlefield. With a flick of her wrist, she commanded her ghastly undead servant to attack. The putrid spirit lurched forward, its decaying form dripping with rot as it moved toward the fleas. As it neared them, a poisonous aura radiated from its body, and the fleas began to wither and die, their tiny forms crumbling to dust as they came into contact with the noxious energy.

Back on the ground, Eirik, the human fighter, was still locked in combat with the massive smoke-wreathed zombie. The creature had fallen once, but it had risen again, its body still crackling with embers. Eirik swung his maul, Gravebreaker, with all his might, the weapon crashing into the zombie’s chest. The impact sent a shockwave through the arena, and the creature staggered once more, but it refused to fall.

As Eirik prepared for another strike, the dust grazer floating above him lashed out with its tentacles, attempting to grapple him just as it had Bog. But Eirik was ready. With a swift motion, he swatted the tentacle away, his reflexes honed from years of battle. "Not today, balloon monster," he growled, his eyes locked on the creature above him.

The battle was far from over, but the party was holding their ground. The altar still stood, though cracks had begun to form in its surface. The creatures of the Thayan Games were relentless, but the party fought on, their determination unwavering. Each member of the group played their part, and together, they stood a chance of surviving the next wave. But as the dust grazer hovered ominously above, its tentacles reaching for its next victim, they knew that the fight was far from over.

The arena was a storm of chaos, with the party locked in a relentless struggle against the bizarre creatures of the Thayan Games. The swarm of fleas, though scattered by earlier attacks, was still a persistent threat, darting across the battlefield in search of warm-blooded prey. As the tiny, bloodthirsty creatures began to slow, their numbers thinned by the party’s efforts, they nevertheless continued to crawl toward Eirik and Corman, undeterred by the carnage around them.

Eirik, surrounded by the swarm and the smoke-wreathed zombie, looked around at his comrades, his face grim. "We need to pick this up!" he shouted over the din of battle, his voice strained but resolute. He gripped his maul, Gravebreaker, and swung it with all his might, aiming to bring the smoldering beast down once and for all. The weight of the weapon connected with a sickening crunch, sending the zombie sprawling to the ground in a heap of ash and embers. But as the creature fell, a plume of smoke erupted from its body, filling the air with choking fumes. Eirik coughed, his vision blurring as he struggled to breathe through the thick cloud.

Undeterred, Eirik raised Gravebreaker again and brought it crashing down on the zombie’s head, hoping to end the fight. As the maul connected, the creature’s skull cracked, but it wasn’t enough to finish the job. Eirik grimaced, feeling the strain in his muscles, and called upon his Second Wind, a surge of energy flooding his body. With newfound vigor, he moved swiftly, stepping up the stairs toward the altar, hoping to gain a better vantage point and avoid the encroaching swarm of fleas.

Meanwhile, Corman, the human paladin, was breathing heavily, his thoughts far from the arena. He thought of his village, of Lathander’s light, and of the people he had sworn to protect. Gritting his teeth, he aimed his longsword at the massive pangolin-like creature that had been tearing through the battlefield. "Shine in his light!" he cried, casting *Guiding Bolt* in an attempt to draw the beast’s attention. But the spell, hindered by the close-quarters combat, went wide, the radiant energy streaking harmlessly over the creature’s head and disappearing into the arena.

Frustration gnawed at Corman, but he had no time to dwell on his missed shot. The pangolin, a massive creature with serrated scales, continued its rampage, and the swarm of fleas was now crawling over him, their tiny bites piercing through the gaps in his armor. The paladin swung his sword in wide arcs, trying to fend off the relentless horde, but the fleas were too small, too numerous. Worse still, the massive ooze creature, a living blob of gelatinous horror, was rolling toward him, its amorphous body threatening to engulf him entirely.

As the ooze neared, it slammed into Corman with a force that nearly knocked him off his feet. The creature’s gelatinous form began to envelop him, its acidic body seeping into his armor. Corman felt the sting of the acid as it started to corrode his gear—the longsword in his hand, the shield at his side, even his armor itself. He grunted in pain, his body trapped within the ooze’s suffocating embrace. He was blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, the goo clinging to him like a living vice.

Desperately, Corman called upon the power of his stone skin, the magical protection he had cast earlier. The spell lessened the damage, but the ooze’s relentless assault continued. He needed to act quickly or risk losing not only his gear but his life. The air around him grew heavy with the stench of decay, and he knew that if he didn’t break free soon, the acid would corrode everything he carried.

Above the battlefield, Thalrok, still in his hornet form, was locked in a deadly duel with the Wok Wok, a massive parrot-like beast that had been terrorizing the skies. The creature, enraged by the flames that had singed its feathers, screeched in fury and lashed out with its talons. Thalrok buzzed through the air, trying to avoid the attack, but the Wok Wok’s claws raked across his carapace, breaking his concentration. The storm clouds that had been swirling above the battlefield began to dissipate, and Thalrok cursed under his breath, struggling to maintain his flight.

Just as the Wok Wok prepared to strike again, Henk, the orc politician, intervened. "No, you don’t!" he growled, casting *Silvery Barbs* in a flash of arcane energy. The spell twisted the Wok Wok’s attack, causing the bird to miss its mark. Thalrok, seizing the opportunity, shifted his carapace slightly, avoiding the brunt of the creature’s fury. The Wok Wok, now fully fixated on the druid, flapped its wings in a desperate attempt to knock him from the sky, but Thalrok held firm, his wings buzzing furiously as he stayed aloft.

Back on the ground, Bog, the satyr monk, was locked in his own struggle. He had managed to slip free from the dust grazer’s tentacles, but the battlefield was still teeming with threats. His fists ached from his earlier encounter with the spiny pangolin, but he refused to back down. Spotting the smoldering zombie that Eirik had been battling, Bog launched into a flurry of blows, his fists striking the creature’s chest with precision. The zombie staggered, but it remained standing, its body still crackling with embers. Bog gritted his teeth, knowing he couldn’t keep this up forever.

As the battle raged on, Nitya, the human wizard, stood near the altar, her mind racing as she surveyed the chaos. Her undead servant had managed to catch a few of the fleas in its poisonous aura, but the swarm was still a threat. Flipping through her spellbook, she found the incantation she needed. With a flick of her wrist, she sent a *firebolt* streaking toward the Wok Wok, hoping to bring the creature down once and for all.

But the fight was far from over, and the party knew that the next wave of creatures could be their last. The altar still stood, but cracks had begun to form in its surface, and the relentless creatures of the Thayan Games showed no signs of stopping. Together, they would need to muster every ounce of strength and resolve if they hoped to survive the battle ahead.

The battle in the Thayan arena had reached a fever pitch, with the party facing relentless waves of bizarre and deadly creatures. Corman, the human paladin, found himself engulfed by the massive ooze creature that had been slowly advancing across the battlefield. Its form was a grotesque amalgamation of rusted weapons and decaying armor, and as Corman was pulled into its gaping maw, he felt the acidic ooze eating away at his armor and gear. His chainmail began to corrode, and the stench of decay filled his nostrils as the ooze threatened to consume him entirely.

Struggling within the creature’s gelatinous body, Corman gritted his teeth and prepared to fight his way out. He knew that each second spent inside the ooze would only bring him closer to death. The ooze’s acidic nature was relentless, and he could feel it seeping into every crevice of his armor. His thoughts raced as he realized the gravity of his situation. The Gamemaster’s voice echoed in his mind, reminding him that his escape would be no small feat. He would need to summon every ounce of strength to break free.

Meanwhile, Bog, the satyr monk, was in the midst of his own struggle. After sprinting across the battlefield and using his mythful leap to launch himself into the air, he had landed atop the dust grazer—a floating, balloon-like creature that hovered ominously above the battlefield. The creature’s surface felt slick and muddy, like a tarp covered in grime, but Bog held on tightly, his fists flying as he attempted to pummel the creature into submission. His first punch connected, but the creature’s strange, rubbery texture absorbed much of the impact, making it difficult to land a solid blow. Undeterred, Bog swung again, this time attempting to grapple the creature. His hands gripped its surface, but it was like trying to hold onto a wet sheet of cloth. Still, he refused to let go, determined to stay atop the creature as it floated dangerously above the arena.

Below, Thalrok, the goliath druid, was locked in an aerial duel with the Wok Wok, a massive parrot-like beast that had been terrorizing the skies. Thalrok, still in his hornet form, buzzed through the air, narrowly evading the Wok Wok’s vicious talons. The bird screeched in frustration as it missed its mark, but Thalrok wasn’t out of danger yet. The Wok Wok wheeled around for another pass, its wings beating furiously as it closed in on the druid. Thalrok, however, was no stranger to aerial combat. With a sharp turn, he executed a flyby maneuver, diving toward the battlefield below and narrowly avoiding the bird’s next attack.

Just as the Wok Wok prepared to strike again, Henk, the orc politician, intervened. With a flash of arcane energy, he cast *Silvery Barbs*, twisting the bird’s attack and causing it to miss its mark. Thalrok seized the opportunity, calling upon the storm clouds he had summoned earlier. A massive bolt of lightning shot down from the sky, striking the battlefield with a deafening crack. The lightning arced through the air, catching the smoke-wreathed zombie that had been menacing Eirik. The zombie exploded in a plume of poisonous gas, its body disintegrating as the lightning coursed through it. The cloud of smoke that remained was thick and dangerous, obscuring the battlefield and making it difficult for anyone to see clearly.

Eirik, the human fighter, had been battling the zombie when it exploded, and now found himself surrounded by the toxic cloud. Coughing as the fumes filled his lungs, he raised his maul, Gravebreaker, and prepared to continue the fight. But the battlefield was rapidly becoming more chaotic. The pangolin-like creature, covered in serrated scales, had mounted the altar and was now swiping at it with single-minded focus. Each swipe of its claws sent cracks spiderwebbing through the altar’s surface, and Eirik knew that if the creature wasn’t stopped soon, the altar would crumble entirely.

Nitya, the human wizard, stood near the altar, her eyes darting between the various threats. She had already summoned a putrid undead servant to deal with the swarm of fleas that had been plaguing the party, and now she turned her attention to the Wok Wok. Flipping through her spellbook, she found the incantation she needed and sent a *firebolt* streaking toward the massive bird. The flames engulfed the Wok Wok, its feathers lighting up like dry tinder. The creature screeched in pain, its once-majestic plumage now singed and charred. It flapped its wings desperately, trying to put out the flames, but the damage had been done.

As the dust grazer with Bog still clinging to its back began to flee the battlefield, it flew dangerously close to Thalrok. The druid, seeing an opportunity, prepared to strike. The Gamemaster’s voice echoed in his mind, reminding him of the opportunity to make an attack as the creature passed by. Thalrok, still in his hornet form, readied himself for the attack, his mandibles clicking in anticipation.

But even as the party fought valiantly, the situation was growing more dire by the second. The altar was crumbling, the creatures of the Thayan Games were relentless, and Corman was still trapped within the ooze. The party would need to muster every ounce of strength and resolve if they hoped to survive the battle ahead.

The arena was a maelstrom of chaos, with the monstrous creatures of the Thayan Games pressing the party to their limits. Eirik Thorne, the human fighter, stood at the forefront, his mighty maul, Gravebreaker, gripped tightly in his hands. The pangolin-like beast—a grotesque, armored creature with serrated scales—had reached the altar, its claws tearing into the sacred stone. Eirik knew that if the beast wasn’t stopped, the altar would be destroyed, and with it, their chances of survival.

With a roar, Eirik charged forward, swinging Gravebreaker in a wide arc. The maul connected with the pangolin’s side, the force of the blow sending the creature toppling onto its back. Its claws flailed in the air, desperately trying to regain footing, but Eirik wasn’t done. He raised Gravebreaker again, the weight of the weapon heavy in his hands, and brought it crashing down onto the beast’s neck. The impact was devastating—dark red blood sprayed across the altar as the pangolin let out a final, pained screech. The fleas that had been swarming the creature scattered, but many began to feast on the fresh blood pooling around the fallen beast.

Eirik, his chest heaving, let out a triumphant roar. He was exhausted, but the battle was far from over. The altar still stood, though cracks now marred its surface, and more creatures continued to close in. He could feel the weight of his duty pressing down on him, but he refused to falter. He would defend the altar to his last breath if need be.

Nearby, Corman, the human paladin, was in a far more dire situation. The ooze creature—an amorphous, gelatinous mass filled with the rusted remains of weapons and armor—had engulfed him. Its acidic body was slowly eating away at his armor, his weapons, and even his flesh. Trapped within the creature, Corman struggled to breathe, the stench of decay and the searing pain of the acid overwhelming his senses. His mind raced, flashes of his childhood filling his thoughts—memories of a time he had fallen from a horse, the sting of failure, and the fear of death. But this was no time for fear. He thought of Lathander, the god of dawn, and the light that had always guided him. He would not die here, not like this.

With a surge of determination, Corman attempted to break free from the ooze. He called upon the divine power of Lathander, hoping to summon the strength to escape. But the creature’s hold on him was too strong. The acid continued to eat away at his armor, corroding his longsword and javelins, and even his shield—Sheila’s Widow—began to hiss and melt under the creature’s relentless assault. The gear that had served him faithfully for so long was now being destroyed, piece by piece.

The Gamemaster’s voice echoed in Corman’s mind, reminding him that his equipment was taking permanent damage. His armor and weapons were now weakened, and if he didn’t escape soon, they would be completely destroyed. But Corman was not ready to give up. He would fight his way out, even if it cost him everything.

Above the battlefield, Thalrok, the goliath druid, was locked in a deadly aerial duel with the Wok Wok, a massive parrot-like beast that had been terrorizing the skies. Thalrok, still in his hornet form, buzzed through the air, narrowly avoiding the Wok Wok’s vicious talons. The bird screeched in frustration, its feathers singed from Nitya’s earlier firebolt. Thalrok, sensing an opportunity, called upon the storm clouds he had summoned earlier. With a flash of lightning, a bolt shot down from the heavens, striking the battlefield below. The lightning arced through the air, catching the Wok Wok and sending a shockwave through its body. The creature screeched in pain, its once-majestic plumage now charred and smoking.

As the Wok Wok faltered in the air, Henk Blackspear, the orc politician, saw his chance. "Not today, birdbrain," he muttered, casting *Silvery Barbs* to further disorient the creature. The spell twisted the Wok Wok’s movements, causing it to miss its next attack on Thalrok. The druid buzzed away, narrowly escaping the bird’s wrath, but the fight was far from over.

Meanwhile, Bog, the satyr monk, was in the midst of his own struggle. After leaping atop the dust grazer—a massive, balloon-like creature that floated ominously above the battlefield—he had tried to pummel the creature into submission. But the dust grazer’s body was slick and rubbery, making it difficult to land a solid blow. Bog’s fists connected, but the creature’s strange texture absorbed much of the impact, leaving the satyr frustrated. He attempted to grapple the creature, his hands gripping its slimy surface, but it was like trying to hold onto a wet tarp. Still, Bog refused to let go, determined to bring the creature down.

Below, Nitya, the human wizard, stood near the altar, her eyes darting between the various threats. She had already summoned her putrid undead servant to deal with the swarm of fleas, and now she turned her attention back to the Wok Wok. Flipping through her spellbook, she found the incantation she needed. With a flick of her wrist, she sent another *firebolt* streaking toward the massive bird. The flames engulfed the Wok Wok once more, and this time, the creature’s screeches of pain were louder, more desperate. Its wings flapped erratically as it tried to stay aloft, but the damage was too great.

As the dust grazer began to flee the battlefield with Bog still clinging to its back, it flew dangerously close to Thalrok. The druid, seeing an opportunity, prepared to strike. His mandibles clicked in anticipation as he readied himself for the attack.

But even as the party fought valiantly, the situation was growing more dire. The altar was crumbling, Corman was trapped within the ooze, and the creatures of the Thayan Games showed no signs of stopping. The party would need to muster every ounce of strength and resolve if they hoped to survive the next wave.

The battle in the Thayan arena raged on, a chaotic dance of survival as the party faced a relentless onslaught of bizarre creatures. Corman, the human paladin, was in dire straits, trapped within the acidic embrace of the gear mass—a grotesque, gelatinous creature made of rusted weapons and decaying armor. Its amorphous body had engulfed him, and the acid within it was slowly eating away at his armor, his weapons, and even his flesh. Corman struggled to free himself, but the creature's grip was too strong. His mind raced as he fought against the overwhelming sensation of suffocation and the searing pain of the acid. He could feel his chainmail corroding, the metal hissing as it dissolved in the creature's body. His shield, Sheila’s Widow, was also beginning to melt, the once-sturdy metal warping under the relentless assault.

Summoning all his strength, Corman attempted to break free, his muscles straining as he pushed against the crushing, acidic form of the gear mass. But his efforts were in vain. The creature's grip tightened, and Corman was pulled deeper into the darkness, his vision fading as the ooze enveloped him completely. Blinded and restrained, he could do nothing but pray for a miracle.

Meanwhile, high above the battlefield, Thalrok, the goliath druid, was locked in combat with the Wok Wok, a massive parrot-like beast that had been terrorizing the skies. Thalrok, still in his hornet form, buzzed through the air, narrowly avoiding the Wok Wok’s vicious beak and talons. The bird screeched in frustration, its feathers singed from Nitya’s earlier firebolt, but it was relentless in its pursuit. With a loud, ungodly honk, the Wok Wok dove at Thalrok again, its talons ripping into his hornet form. The druid winced as he felt the sharp claws tear through his carapace, and his concentration faltered. The storm clouds he had summoned earlier began to dissipate, leaving the battlefield exposed to the harsh Thayan sun.

As Thalrok struggled to maintain his flight, the gear mass, seemingly satisfied with its haul, began to crawl slowly toward the altar, dragging Corman’s trapped form along with it. The creature moved with a sluggish, deliberate pace, its gelatinous body rippling as it advanced. The crowd roared in approval, sensing the party’s growing disadvantage.

On the ground, Eirik Thorne, the human fighter, was fending off a swarm of fleas that had been plaguing him throughout the battle. The tiny creatures buzzed around him, their bites relentless as they sought to drain his blood. Eirik swung his maul, Gravebreaker, in wide arcs, trying to fend off the swarm, but the fleas were too small and too numerous to be taken down easily. His eyes flicked toward the gear mass, where Corman was trapped, and he knew he had to act quickly if he was going to save his comrade.

With a determined grunt, Eirik dodged the swarm of fleas and charged toward the gear mass. He hoisted Gravebreaker high above his head and brought it crashing down onto the creature’s form. The impact sent a shockwave through the arena, but to Eirik’s dismay, the gear mass absorbed the blow, its gelatinous body rippling but remaining intact. The creature’s form seemed to fold in on itself, as if mocking Eirik’s efforts. Gritting his teeth, Eirik swung again, hoping to topple the beast, but once again, the ooze absorbed the blow, its form refusing to yield.

Above, Bog, the satyr monk, was still atop the dust grazer, a massive, balloon-like creature that floated ominously above the battlefield. Bog had been pummeling the creature’s soft, bulbous body, but despite his best efforts, the dust grazer’s strange, rubbery texture absorbed much of the impact. Frustrated, Bog decided to try a different tactic. He attempted to grapple the creature, his hands gripping its slick surface in an effort to gain some control over it. But the dust grazer’s body was slippery, like trying to hold onto a wet tarp, and Bog found himself struggling to maintain his grip.

As Bog continued his assault, the dust grazer began to float higher into the air, sensing the threat posed by the monk. It rose another thirty feet, lifting Bog with it, until they were both nearly forty-five feet above the arena floor. The crowd gasped in awe as the creature ascended, and Bog, still clinging to its back, cursed under his breath. He knew that if the creature flew any higher, he would be in serious trouble.

Back on the ground, Nitya, the human wizard, stood near the altar, her eyes darting between the various threats. She had already summoned her putrid undead servant to deal with the swarm of fleas, and now she turned her attention back to the Wok Wok. Flipping through her spellbook, she found the incantation she needed. With a flick of her wrist, she sent another firebolt streaking toward the massive bird. The flames engulfed the Wok Wok once more, and this time, the creature’s screeches of pain were louder, more desperate. Its wings flapped erratically as it tried to stay aloft, but the damage was too great.

As the Wok Wok faltered in the air, Henk Blackspear, the orc politician, saw his chance. "Not today, birdbrain," he muttered, casting *Silvery Barbs* to further disorient the creature. The spell twisted the Wok Wok’s movements, causing it to miss its next attack on Thalrok. The druid, seeing an opening, buzzed away, narrowly escaping the bird’s talons.

But even as the party fought valiantly, the situation was growing more dire by the second. The altar was crumbling, Corman was still trapped within the ooze, and the creatures of the Thayan Games showed no signs of stopping. The party would need to muster every ounce of strength and resolve if they hoped to survive the next wave.

The battle in the Thayan Games had reached a fever pitch, with each member of the party locked in life-or-death struggles against monstrous foes. Corman, the human paladin, had just been spat out from the clutches of the gear mass, a grotesque ooze-like creature that had nearly consumed him whole. His skin was burning, his muscles stiff, and his vision blurred as he wiped the acidic filth from his eyes. Panic gripped him as he realized how close he had come to death, but there was no time to dwell on it. He was still dangerously close to the gear mass, and any attempt to flee would provoke another attack.

Gritting his teeth, Corman reached into his pack and hastily downed a healing potion, feeling the soothing liquid work its magic on his ravaged body. His breath came in ragged gasps, but with his strength somewhat restored, he turned his gaze back to the creature that had nearly devoured him. His longsword, visibly decayed from the acid, was still his only weapon. With a desperate cry, he raised the blade high and invoked the power of Lathander, channeling divine energy into the sword. “Die for what you did to me!” he roared, swinging the weapon with all his might. The sword, though weakened, flared with radiant light as Corman unleashed a Divine Smite, hoping to invoke the wrath of his god against the abomination before him.

Meanwhile, high above the battlefield, the Wok Wok, a massive parrot-like beast, had turned its attention to the dust grazer—an enormous, floating jellyfish-like creature that hovered ominously over the arena. Bog, the satyr monk, had been riding the dust grazer, trying to pummel it into submission, when the Wok Wok swooped down and unleashed a devastating wingslap. The force of the blow knocked Bog from the dust grazer’s back, sending him plummeting toward the arena floor. Fortunately, Bog’s reflexes kicked in, and he activated his Slow Fall ability, reducing the impact of the fall. He landed with a thud, prone on the ground but unharmed.

Cursing under his breath, Bog quickly scrambled to his feet, dusting himself off. He glanced up at the two massive creatures still locked in aerial combat above him and decided that discretion was the better part of valor. He had no desire to be caught between them again. With a quick sprint, he dashed across the battlefield, putting as much distance between himself and the flying beasts as possible. But before continuing the fight, he paused, pulling a healing potion from his belt and downing it in one swift motion. The burning in his muscles eased slightly, but the fight was far from over.

Back near the altar, Eirik Thorne, the human fighter, was battling the gear mass alongside Corman. His mighty maul, Gravebreaker, had already dealt significant damage to the creature, but the ooze was relentless. With each swing, Eirik’s weapon clanged against the rusted metal embedded within the creature’s body—remnants of past victims who had not been so lucky. Eirik gritted his teeth and swung again, determined to tear the creature apart before it could claim another victim. His strikes sent ripples through the creature’s gelatinous form, but it continued to press forward, its hunger palpable.

As Corman fought to regain his composure, the gear mass lashed out again, attempting to engulf him once more. Its first attack missed, but the second was dangerously close. Just as it seemed that the creature would succeed in reclaiming its prey, Henk Blackspear, the orc politician, intervened. With a quick incantation, Henk cast *Silvery Barbs*, twisting fate in Corman’s favor. The gear mass’s attack faltered, and Corman, his heart pounding in his chest, narrowly avoided being swallowed again. Henk’s spell also granted Corman a brief moment of clarity, allowing him to brace for the next assault.

The battle raged on, but the party was not without its share of victories. Above, Thalrok, the goliath druid, still in his hornet form, buzzed through the air, narrowly avoiding the Wok Wok’s vicious talons. The bird, its feathers singed and smoking from Nitya’s firebolts, was growing more desperate. With a flash of lightning, Thalrok called upon the storm clouds he had summoned earlier, sending a bolt of energy crashing down onto the battlefield. The Wok Wok screeched in pain as the lightning coursed through its body, but it wasn’t enough to bring the creature down.

Nitya, the human wizard, stood near the altar, her eyes darting between the various threats. The Wok Wok was still a menace, but the gear mass posed an immediate danger to her comrades. Flipping through her spellbook, she found the incantation she needed. With a flick of her wrist, she sent another firebolt streaking toward the Wok Wok, hoping to finish the job. The flames engulfed the bird once more, and this time, its screeches of pain were louder, more desperate. Its wings flapped erratically as it tried to stay aloft, but the damage was too great. The Wok Wok faltered, its majestic plumage now reduced to charred feathers.

As the dust grazer hovered ominously above, the party knew the battle was far from over. The altar was still standing, though cracks had begun to form in its surface. The creatures of the Thayan Games were relentless, and the gear mass, though damaged, was still a threat. But the party had faced impossible odds before, and they would face them again—together.

The chaos of the Thayan arena was reaching its peak. The dust grazer, a massive, floating creature that had been looming ominously above, suddenly shuddered, its bulbous form trembling before erupting in a violent explosion. A thick, frothy liquid sprayed across the battlefield, coating the Wok Wok—a gargantuan parrot-like beast—in a layer of bubbling oil. The crowd gasped as the Wok Wok, now slick and gleaming, flapped its wings in frustration, momentarily blinded by the substance. 

On the ground, Bog, the satyr monk, breathed a sigh of relief, grateful that he had fallen from the dust grazer moments before its explosive demise. He glanced around, taking stock of the battlefield. The air was thick with the stench of blood and burning feathers, and the cacophony of battle filled his ears. His muscles ached, but there was no time to rest. The fight was far from over.

Nearby, Nitya, the human wizard, stood with her spellbook in hand, her eyes locked onto the Wok Wok. She raised her hand, preparing to unleash another firebolt, but a swarm of fleas scuttled toward her, their tiny forms crawling over her shield. She clicked her tongue in frustration, knowing that the pests would make casting difficult. Still, she maintained her concentration, her eyes narrowing as she aimed her spell at the bird. 

"Now’s your chance, boys!" she called out, her voice sharp with urgency. The Wok Wok was vulnerable, and the melee fighters needed to strike while the creature was distracted.

Eirik Thorne, the human fighter, heard Nitya’s call and turned his attention to the frozen form of the gear mass. The grotesque ooze creature had been paralyzed by the necrotic touch of Nitya’s undead minion, its gelatinous body stiffening as if infected by some foul rot. Eirik grinned, rubbing his hands together in anticipation. This was his moment.

With Gravebreaker in hand, Eirik swung with all his might, aiming for the heart of the creature. His first strike missed, the maul glancing off the ooze’s rubbery surface, but he quickly adjusted his stance. His next swing connected with a sickening thud, and he felt the energy of Gravebreaker hum through his arms as the weapon critically hit the beast. The gear mass shuddered, chunks of its body falling to the ground as Eirik’s relentless assault began to tear it apart.

As Eirik continued his assault, Corman, the human paladin, stood nearby, his longsword in hand. His armor was corroded, his body weakened from the acidic touch of the gear mass, but his eyes blazed with a fury the party had never seen before. "Die!" he roared, his voice hoarse with desperation. He swung his damaged sword at the creature, but the blade was barely holding together, its form already starting to dissipate from the acid’s relentless assault.

But Corman was not done. With a final, desperate cry, he called upon the power of Lathander, channeling divine energy into his strike. His sword flared with radiant light as he unleashed a Divine Smite, the force of the attack cutting deep into the gear mass. The ooze quivered, struggling to maintain its form, but it was clear that the creature was on the verge of collapse.

Above, the Wok Wok, still slick with the dust grazer’s oily remains, circled the battlefield, its eyes locked onto Eirik. The bird let out a guttural screech, its wings beating furiously as it dove toward the fighter. It couldn’t resist the challenge Eirik presented, though its gaze briefly flickered toward the altar, as if considering an attack on the sacred stone. But the Wok Wok’s pride won out, and it landed with a heavy thump beside Eirik, its talons digging into the ground as it prepared to strike.

The Wok Wok’s beak lashed out, catching Eirik in the side, followed by a vicious swipe from its talons. The fighter grunted in pain, stumbling back, but the bird wasn’t finished. With a powerful flap of its wings, the Wok Wok unleashed a devastating wingslap, sending Eirik sprawling to the ground. The crowd roared as the massive bird stood triumphant, its wings outstretched, a menacing silhouette against the burning sky.

Meanwhile, the gear mass, still paralyzed by the undead’s touch, was beginning to regain its form. Its gelatinous body rippled as it struggled to move, but the damage it had sustained was severe. Chunks of its body littered the ground, and it was clear that the creature was nearing its end. The poison that had been coursing through it was starting to fade, but the ooze was still vulnerable.

Henk Blackspear, the orc politician, watched the scene unfold with a calculating eye. He saw the opportunity to strike and cast *Silvery Barbs*, twisting fate in Corman’s favor. The gear mass’s next attack faltered, and Corman, fueled by Henk’s intervention, braced himself for the final blow. The paladin’s eyes met Bog’s across the battlefield, a silent plea for help passing between them.

Bog, seeing the desperation in Corman’s gaze, nodded grimly. He had seen this look before—the fear of death, the knowledge that time was running out. Without hesitation, the satyr monk charged forward, his fists flying as he attacked the gear mass. His strikes were precise, each blow landing with a satisfying thud as the creature’s form continued to disintegrate.

The battle was nearing its climax. The gear mass was on the verge of collapse, the Wok Wok was wounded, and the altar, though cracked, still stood. But the creatures of the Thayan Games were relentless, and the party knew that their fight was far from over. Together, they would need to muster every ounce of strength and resolve if they hoped to survive the next wave.

As the dust settled and the crowd roared in approval, the party stood united, their eyes locked on the remaining threats. The Thayan Games were brutal, but they had come too far to fail now.

The arena was a battlefield of chaos, with the party locked in a desperate struggle to defend the altar against the bizarre and deadly creatures of the Thayan Games. The gear mass, a grotesque ooze creature made of corroded armor and rusted weapons, had finally met its end. With a final strike from Bog, the satyr monk, the creature’s gelatinous form quivered and collapsed. Its body, once a writhing mass of acidic slime, now lay in a lifeless heap, spilling its contents—discarded weapons and shattered armor—across the blood-soaked sand. Bog, bracing himself for an explosion that never came, cautiously stepped back, wiping the sweat from his brow. He had landed the killing blow, but there was no time to celebrate; the battle was far from over.

Thalrok, the goliath druid, approached Corman, the human paladin, who had been on the brink of death mere moments ago. The paladin’s body was ravaged by the acidic touch of the gear mass, his armor corroded and his flesh burned. Thalrok, his heart heavy with the weight of the battle, extended his hand, channeling the ancient magic of the druids. A giant blue fist of healing energy enveloped Corman, restoring his body and spirit. The paladin’s wounds closed, and even the lingering effects of the acid vanished. Corman, who had been teetering on the edge of death, was now fully restored, his eyes wide with awe.

"This... this is the ancient magic of the druids," Corman whispered, his voice filled with reverence. He had read about such power but had never experienced it firsthand. The light of Lathander had always been his guide, but this magic was something else entirely. He glanced at Thalrok, gratitude evident in his gaze. The druid had saved his life.

As Corman regained his strength, Nitya, the human wizard, found herself surrounded by a swarm of fleas. The tiny creatures, drawn by the blood and carnage of the battlefield, scuttled toward her, their bites relentless. In a moment of panic, she cast a fireball, hoping to incinerate the pests, but the spell missed its mark. Desperate, she commanded her putrid undead servant to attack the Wok Wok, the massive parrot-like beast that had been terrorizing the skies. The undead creature’s rotting claws raked across the bird’s body, but the fleas continued their assault, crawling onto Nitya and biting with ferocity.

Seeing the swarm closing in on Nitya, Henk Blackspear, the orc politician, acted quickly. With a flick of his wrist, he cast *Silvery Barbs*, twisting fate in Nitya’s favor. The swarm’s attack faltered, and Nitya was able to dodge the worst of the bites. Henk, ever the strategist, granted himself a brief moment of advantage as well, preparing for whatever came next.

Meanwhile, Eirik Thorne, the human fighter, was locked in a fierce struggle with the Wok Wok. The massive bird had been strutting triumphantly, convinced of its dominance over the battlefield. Eirik, however, was not willing to let the creature claim victory. With a grunt of effort, he pulled himself to his feet, his body battered and bruised from the relentless barrage of attacks. Fueled by rage, he grabbed the bird’s feathery tail and swung his maul, Gravebreaker, with all his might. His first strike missed, the exhaustion of battle weighing heavily on him, but his second swing connected with a satisfying thud. The Wok Wok squawked in surprise, momentarily losing its balance, but it quickly recovered, high-stepping away from Eirik’s next attack with an almost mocking grace.

Frustrated but undeterred, Eirik tugged a healing potion from his belt and downed it in one swift motion. The potion’s magic coursed through his veins, easing the pain of his wounds, but the fight was far from over. The Wok Wok, still strutting and squawking, turned its attention to the altar, its eyes gleaming with malicious intent.

Corman, now fully healed and emboldened by Thalrok’s magic, stepped forward with renewed confidence. His longsword, though damaged from the acid, still gleamed with the light of Lathander. With a nod of gratitude to Thalrok, he charged toward the swarm of fleas that had been harassing his comrades. His sword cut through the air, and with a brilliant flash of divine energy, he unleashed a *Divine Smite*. The swarm of fleas, caught in the radiant blast, disintegrated, their tiny bodies scattered across the sand.

"Got a bug problem, Thalrok?" Corman quipped, stepping through the dissipating swarm with a grin. He was feeling invincible now, the fear of death a distant memory.

As the Wok Wok prepared to take flight, its eyes fixed on the altar, Eirik saw his chance. With a roar of defiance, he swung Gravebreaker once more, aiming for the bird’s wings. The Wok Wok, however, was too quick. It dodged the blow, high-stepping away with a mocking squawk. The bird was dominant, its massive wings casting a shadow over the battlefield as it took flight, but Eirik was not done yet. He would not let the creature reach the altar.

With the battle still raging, the party knew they had to act quickly. The altar, though still standing, was cracked and damaged, and the Wok Wok was circling above, ready to strike. But the party had faced impossible odds before, and they would face them again—together. 

As the dust settled and the crowd roared in approval, the party stood united, their weapons ready, their resolve unshaken. The Thayan Games were brutal, but they had come too far to fail now. The Wok Wok, the fleas, and the remnants of the gear mass were just the beginning. The real challenge was yet to come.

The arena was a swirling storm of chaos, the air thick with the cries of the crowd and the relentless buzzing of the fleas that swarmed over the battlefield. The Wok Wok, a massive parrot-like beast, had landed near the altar and was now viciously pecking at the sacred stone, its talons digging into the cracked surface. The party, battered and bloodied, fought to hold their ground, each member locked in a desperate struggle against the bizarre creatures of the Thayan Games.

Bog, the satyr monk, sprinted across the battlefield, his hooves kicking up sand as he made his way toward the swarms of fleas that had been harassing Nitya, the human wizard. His fists flew, striking the pests with precision, but no matter how many he crushed, more seemed to crawl out of the shadows, their tiny bodies relentless in their assault. "Good lord," Bog muttered under his breath as he swatted away another handful of fleas, realizing that his efforts were barely making a dent in their numbers.

Nearby, Thalrok, the goliath druid, struggled to his feet after being knocked down by the Wok Wok’s powerful wingslap. He winced, feeling the sting of his wounds, but there was no time for rest. Thalrok quickly channeled his druidic magic, healing himself as best he could. He glanced around the battlefield, his eyes narrowing as he saw the Wok Wok still attacking the altar. "I feel like I’m saving everyone out here," he grumbled, but there was no time for complaints. The fight was far from over.

Nitya, surrounded by fleas on one side and the Wok Wok on the other, raised her hand and made a pinching gesture. With a sharp incantation, she unleashed an infestation of stinging insects upon the Wok Wok. The magical swarm surrounded the massive bird, causing it to screech in frustration as it flapped its wings and stumbled away from the altar. The crowd gasped as the Wok Wok, clearly disoriented, moved five feet away from the sacred stone, giving the party a brief reprieve.

The undead servant Nitya had summoned earlier, a ghastly spirit dripping with rot, raked its claws across the Wok Wok’s feathers, further weakening the beast. The Wok Wok, once so proud and dominant, was now visibly struggling, its movements sluggish as it tried to escape the magical swarm and the relentless attacks of the party.

Eirik Thorne, the human fighter, had had enough. He watched as the Wok Wok, still slick from the dust grazer’s oily remains, prepared to take flight again. "Not today," he growled, gripping his maul, Gravebreaker, tightly. With a roar, Eirik charged toward the bird, dragging his weapon behind him in the sand before swinging it upward in a powerful uppercut. His strike connected with the Wok Wok’s beak, shattering it into pieces. Blood sprayed from the wound as the bird let out a final, pained screech before collapsing in a burst of feathers. The once-proud Wok Wok lay defeated, its body crumpled in the sand.

As the Wok Wok fell, every single one of the swarms of fleas that had been plaguing the party converged on the bird’s lifeless body, disappearing into the mass of feathers and blood. Eirik, still seething with rage, swung his maul at the retreating fleas, but they were too quick, vanishing into the corpse before he could land a blow. "Get out of here, you bugs," he muttered, though the fight was clearly over.

With the Wok Wok defeated and the fleas retreating, the battlefield grew eerily quiet. The party, exhausted but victorious, surveyed the scene. The body of the Wok Wok lay in a pool of blood and feathers, the gear mass had been reduced to a wretched puddle of liquid, and the smoldering remains of the zombie still sent plumes of smoke into the air. The altar, though cracked and damaged, still stood.

Eirik turned to Nitya, his voice filled with urgency. "Mend the altar! We don’t know what’s coming next." Nitya, her hands still trembling from the battle, nodded and began casting her mending spell, working quickly to repair the damage done to the sacred stone. But as she worked, she called out to the group, her voice filled with doubt. "We should throw in the towel. This isn’t worth dying over."

Before anyone could respond, the arena fell into an uneasy silence. The crowd, which had been cheering and jeering moments before, quieted as a figure emerged from the shadows. The booming voice of the Tharchion rang out across the arena, announcing the party’s victory. "The Lord’s Alliance has triumphed! They have defended Lord Zaztom’s Holy Altar, much like the forefathers before them."

The crowd, once filled with bloodthirsty excitement, was now murmuring in disappointment. Many of the other competitors looked on in disbelief, clearly disturbed by the fact that the party had managed to survive the brutal trials of the Thayan Games. They had faced not only the twin crimson apes but also a host of savage beasts and scavengers, and yet, they stood victorious.

As the Tharchion’s voice echoed through the arena, the party exchanged weary glances. They had survived the impossible, but the cost had been high. The altar was damaged, their bodies were battered, and the creatures of the Thayan Games had pushed them to their limits. But for now, they had won. They had defended the altar, and they had lived to fight another day.

The crowd’s disappointment was palpable, but the party knew that they had accomplished something remarkable. Together, they had faced impossible odds, and together, they had emerged victorious. The Thayan Games were brutal, but the Lord’s Alliance had proven that they were a force to be reckoned with.

The dust of the arena had barely settled when the booming voice of the Tharchion announced the party's victory. The crowd, once roaring with bloodthirsty excitement, now murmured in a mix of awe and disappointment. The altar, though cracked and battered from the relentless onslaught of the creatures, had been defended. The Lord’s Alliance had triumphed, and the Tharchion’s voice echoed through the arena, proclaiming their success.

Eirik Thorne, exhausted but triumphant, stood tall, his maul, Gravebreaker, still clenched tightly in his hands. "Thank you," he muttered over and over, his voice barely audible over the din of the crowd. His body ached from the battle, every muscle strained, but there was a sense of satisfaction in his eyes. They had faced impossible odds and emerged victorious. 

The magical altar at the center of the arena began to glow, its surface shimmering as it restored itself, preparing for the next round of the games. The crowd’s attention shifted, but for the party, this was a moment to breathe, to reflect on what they had just endured. 

Corman, his armor still corroded from the acidic touch of the gear mass, approached Nitya, the human wizard, who had played a crucial role in their victory. He wiped the sweat from his brow and offered her a nod of respect. "You know, Nitya, there was no way we would have quit. We’re only halfway through this. Your magic was impressive, but..." He hesitated, choosing his words carefully. "It seems like you weren’t taking being part of this team seriously."

Nitya scoffed, her eyes narrowing as she turned to face him. "My life is not worth any contest or display of strength, young man," she retorted, her tone sharp. She turned on her heel, not waiting for a response, and began to make her way out of the arena, leaving the others behind. 

Henk Blackspear, the orc politician, chuckled softly, watching the exchange. He had seen enough of these contests to know that not everyone shared the same sense of duty or camaraderie. "Well, that went well," he muttered under his breath, shaking his head.

Meanwhile, Thalrok, the goliath druid, approached Corman, Bog, and Eirik, offering each of them a unique handshake, a gesture of solidarity after the battle. The camaraderie between them was palpable, each handshake a reminder of the trust they had built through the trials of the arena. Bog, ever the satyr, ended his handshake with a playful headbutt, eliciting a laugh from the group.

As the adrenaline of battle began to fade, the party found a moment to rest. The arena, now preparing for the next round of contestants, gave them a brief reprieve. Eirik, always practical, wasted no time in finding a spot in the stands to kick back and take a short rest. "I’m going to snooze for a bit," he said, reclining against the stone seats. "Wake me when something interesting happens."

The others followed suit, each finding a place to rest and recover. Thalrok, still feeling the sting of his wounds, closed his eyes and allowed the magic of the land to heal him. Corman, despite his earlier brush with death, sat in quiet contemplation, his mind still replaying the events of the battle. He was grateful for the healing magic that had saved him, but the weight of his near-death experience lingered.

Nitya, however, did not stay to rest. She had made her feelings clear—this contest was not worth risking her life. Without a word, she left the arena entirely, retreating to her quarters to recover in solitude. The others didn’t question her decision; they knew that each of them had their own way of coping with the horrors they had faced.

For the next few hours, the group watched as other Tharks entered the arena, each facing their own set of challenges. The booming voice of the Tharchion echoed through the stands as he announced the next round of contestants. The party, now rested, observed the battles with a mix of interest and exhaustion. Though they had survived their round, they knew that the games were far from over.

The other competitors were standoffish, their eyes filled with anxiety as they prepared for their own trials. There were no congratulations for the party, no pats on the back. In the Thayan Games, victory was fleeting, and the next challenge was always just around the corner.

As the sun began to dip lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the arena, the party remained vigilant. They had earned their rest, but they knew that the Thayan Games were unforgiving. The next wave of challenges could come at any moment, and they would need to be ready.

For now, though, they had survived. The altar still stood, and the Lord’s Alliance had proven that they were a force to be reckoned with. But the real question lingered in the back of their minds: how long could they keep this up? The Thayan Games were brutal, and the creatures they had faced were only the beginning.

As the crowd’s cheers faded into the background, the party settled into an uneasy calm, knowing that the next battle was just over the horizon.

As the dust settled from the party's hard-fought victory, the arena was already preparing for the next wave of competitors. The Thayan Games were far from over, and the remaining Tharks were eager to prove their mettle. The Lord’s Alliance had survived the brutal trials, but the other teams were not so fortunate.

The first Thark to follow the heroes was the Thark of Thasulhar, bearing the colors of white. They were a formidable group, consisting of Amara, Xandor, Alara, and Hargen Vord. From the start, their approach was strategic and well-coordinated. Amara, wielding divine magic, bolstered the altar with protective wards, while Xandor unleashed devastating blasts of evocation magic, including fireballs that rained down on the twin crimson apes. Alara, a summoner of dark magic, called forth a swarm of demonic insects to counter the smaller apes, and Hargen, a fearsome orc spellcaster, held the line with raw barbaric strength. 

The first wave seemed manageable for the Thasulhar team, but when the second wave hit, their defenses began to falter. The dire pangolin and the relentless gear mass overpowered Amara’s wards, and the team struggled to contain the chaos. Xandor managed to bring down the Wok Wok with a powerful lightning bolt, but the endless swarm of fleas and the smoke-plumed zombies’ toxic aura made the situation dire. Alara Nier was gravely injured, and despite a heroic last stand by Xandor, the altar was ultimately destroyed by the fleas. Amara called for a tactical retreat, ending Thasulhar’s participation in the games. The white team had fallen.

Next came the Thark of Thaymount, the favorites of the competition, wearing the colors of yellow. Led by Valis Karn, they took an aggressive approach from the outset. Valis, a master of elemental magic, summoned an earth elemental to defend the altar and used his powers to manipulate the battlefield. The apes, once a formidable threat, lost their advantage as Valis bent the elements to his will, causing the trees they used for cover to turn against them. The elemental creatures intercepted the bombs hurled by the twin crimson apes, turning the explosive projectiles back on the attackers and decimating the smaller foes.

In the second wave, Valis once again took control of the arena, summoning gale-force winds to blow the Wok Wok high into the sky and using the earth to bind the pangolin. The team worked together to isolate and eliminate the threats, but despite their best efforts, the gear mass reached the altar and consumed it entirely. Like Thasulhar, Thaymount lost their defense, and their hopes of victory slipped away.

The Thark of Sirthay, who had shared lodging with the party, was next to face the arena’s horrors. Commanded by the diviner Yafl, their strategy relied heavily on foresight and divination magic. They placed magical traps around the altar, hoping to predict the movements of the twin crimson apes. Early on, their reliance on divination paid off, as the bombs from the apes were intercepted by magical shields. However, their defense faltered when the swarm of apes overwhelmed the spellcasters. One of their members, a drow, was incapacitated by a direct hit from a bomb. The second wave proved even more taxing, as the smoke-plumed zombie bypassed their arcane defenses and exploded within their shield, causing a choking cloud of smoke that blinded the team. The swarm of fleas overtook the altar, and despite their best efforts, Sirthay too was defeated.

The Thark of Lapprindir, wearing teal, entered the arena with confidence, relying on the brute magical force of evocation and abjuration. They conjured walls of fire and arcane barriers, which easily destroyed the twin crimson apes. However, their overconfidence proved to be their downfall. When the second wave hit, they were ill-prepared to handle the gear mass. Talion Drufen, one of their spellcasters, was absorbed by the flying balloon-like monster, nearly killed in the process. The Wok Wok swooped down on one of their mages and began assaulting the altar. The team was unable to contain the gear mass and the pangolin, which taunted them by circling the arena. Lapprindir, like the others, failed to protect the altar.

Finally, the black team from Garros, led by necromancers Valandra Shadowmantle and Nirak Vathor, entered the arena. Their approach was as dark and eerie as their reputation. Immediately, they summoned a host of undead creatures to serve as their first line of defense. The apes hurled bombs, but the sheer number of undead clouded the arena, tearing apart the smaller apes with ease. The larger apes posed more of a challenge, but eventually, the undead swarmed them as well. In the second wave, Garros thrived in the chaos. The necromancers turned the smoke-plumed zombie against the other creatures, and their undead clashed violently with the pangolin and gear mass. The fleas, initially problematic, were cleared out by a sharp cloud of acidic mass summoned by the necromancers. In the end, Garros survived the onslaught, but even their dark magic could not protect the altar from destruction.

As the final teams fell one by one, the party watched from the stands, their bodies still aching from their own battle. They had survived the Thayan Games, but the cost had been high. The altar had been defended, but the creatures they had faced were unlike anything they had ever seen. The other teams had fought valiantly, but none had been able to protect the altar from the relentless waves of monstrous threats.

For now, the Lord’s Alliance stood victorious, but the Thayan Games were far from over. The next round of challenges awaited, and the party knew that they would need to muster every ounce of strength and resolve if they hoped to survive what was to come.

The Thayan Games continued to unfold with a relentless pace, as the party from the Lord’s Alliance watched the remaining Tharks compete. The arena, still stained with the blood of fallen creatures and the remnants of shattered spells, was now a stage for the other teams to prove their worth. Each Thark had its own unique approach, but the challenges remained brutal and unforgiving.

The Garros Thark, led by necromancers Valandra Shadowmantle and Nirak Vathor, had emerged victorious in a display of eerie dark magic. With an army of undead at their command, they overwhelmed the twin crimson apes and repelled the second wave of monstrous creatures. Their victory, much like the heroes of the Lord’s Alliance, had been hard-fought, but their dark arts had given them an edge in the chaotic arena.

Next came the Thark of Delhumide, the Red Team, specializing in transmutation and martial prowess. Thalrok, the goliath druid, recognized one of their members—Jorik Ironskin, the man from whom he had once lifted an amulet. The Delhumide team used their mastery of transmutation to reshape the arena itself, raising walls of stone and transforming the ground into quicksand to trap the smaller apes. One of the larger apes met its end in a pit of transmuted spikes, and when the second wave arrived, the team adapted once more. They turned the dire pangolin’s scales into fragile glass, shattering it with coordinated attacks. Jorik himself felled the Wok Wok with a single, well-aimed javelin, sealing their victory.

The final team to compete was the Pryador Thark, the Blue Team, known for their magical versatility. Led by Miranda Alathys, they approached the first wave with precision and coordination. Lisa Moonshadow took to the skies, conjuring wind weapons to strike down the apes, while Miranda drained the energy from one of the larger beasts. However, the second wave proved too much for them. The gear mass broke through their defenses, and the Wok Wok distracted Vortac with a brutal mauling. Despite Sether Voss’s ice magic slowing the gear mass, the toxic environment created by the smoke-plumed zombie and the relentless fleas forced Vortac to call for a forfeit. The Pryador Thark’s retreat marked the end of their participation in the games.

With the battles concluded, it became clear that only three Tharks had emerged victorious: the Lord’s Alliance, Garros, and Delhumide. The rest had fallen, their altars destroyed by the relentless waves of creatures. The heroes of the Lord’s Alliance, though battered and bruised, had survived the impossible and now found themselves among the few who had triumphed in the arena.

As the hours passed, the party found a moment to rest and reflect on their victory. Nitya, the human wizard, had retreated to her apartment after the battle, clearly shaken by the events. Her apartment, located in a less-than-desirable part of town, was far from the comforts of the mage district. Along the way, she stopped by a local merchant, purchasing a diamond and some burning incense before ritually casting *Find Familiar* to summon her hyena companion. With her familiar by her side, she made her way back to the arena, ready to rejoin her comrades.

Meanwhile, Corman, the human paladin, was focused on repairing his damaged gear. His longsword and shield had been corroded by the gear mass’s acidic touch, and he needed replacements before the next round of the games. He made a pit stop at the Pit of Eternal Servitude, where discarded weapons and armor were plentiful. There, he found a new longsword, shield, and a fresh set of javelins. With his gear restored, Corman returned to his quarters to retrieve his weightlifting shorts—a cherished item made by his aunt, which he wore in all his competitions. He had a feeling he would need them soon.

Bog, the satyr monk, also took some time to recover, though his mind was on more practical matters. "Would there be a concession stand or a locker room with free potions?" he asked, half-jokingly, as he looked around the arena. The answer, unfortunately, was no. There were no free potions to be found, but the group had managed to survive without them so far.

As the party regrouped, they learned that the next events were fast approaching: the feats of strength and the necromancy rites. Though there was no immediate rush, they knew they would need to be ready when the time came. The Thayan Games were far from over, and the next round of challenges would be just as brutal as the last.

Thalrok, ever the strategist, took a moment to cast a spell on Corman, bolstering the paladin’s defenses before the next competition. The group exchanged weary glances, knowing that they would need to rely on each other more than ever in the coming trials.

For now, they had earned a brief respite. The arena, once filled with the screams of battle, was quiet. The other Tharks had either fallen or retreated, and the Lord’s Alliance stood among the victorious. But the Thayan Games were unforgiving, and the real challenges were still to come.

As they prepared for the next event, the party knew one thing for certain: they had survived the first wave, but the Thayan Games were far from over. The feats of strength and the necromancy rites awaited, and the heroes of the Lord’s Alliance would need every ounce of strength and resolve to face what was to come.

As the dust of the Thayan Games settled, the party found themselves preparing for the next challenge: the Feats of Strength. Corman, the human paladin, had been through a grueling ordeal, his stone skin finally sloughing off after hours of battle. He smirked to himself as the last remnants of the spell peeled away, revealing his skin underneath. He wouldn’t need it anymore—this was his moment to shine. 

The group had scattered briefly after the last event, each tending to their own needs. Corman had returned to the Pit of Eternal Servitude to retrieve his lucky lifting shorts, a cherished item that had seen him through many a competition. Meanwhile, Bog, the satyr monk, and Eirik Thorne, the human fighter, had ventured into the marketplace, stocking up on healing potions to prepare for whatever challenges lay ahead. The prices were steep—ten gold coins for each potion—but it was a necessary expense in a place as unforgiving as the Thayan Games.

As the party reconvened, they made their way to the construct offices where the Feats of Strength would take place. Corman, ever the competitor, was already hyping himself up, swinging his arms back and forth like a boxer preparing for a title fight. His lucky shorts were on, and he was ready. "You want to see how winning is done?" he quipped to Nitya, the human wizard, as they walked. He was feeling confident, maybe a little too confident, as he flexed his muscles at Bog, who could only roll his eyes in response.

Thalrok, the goliath druid, approached Corman with a knowing grin, offering him a handshake and a pinch of lifting chalk. The druid then cast *Enhance Ability*, bolstering Corman’s strength with the ancient magic of the druids. Corman could feel the power coursing through his veins, his muscles tightening in anticipation. "Yeah, yeah, fuck me up," he muttered, flexing his legs and feeling invincible.

As they entered the great hall where the competition would take place, they were greeted by an impressive sight. Eight clearly marked squares, each containing a small black obelisk, lined the arena. Flaming braziers stood at the edges of the space, casting flickering light over the competitors who were stretching, meditating, or studying books in preparation. At the far end of the hall, a massive golem-like entity was chained to the ground, its presence looming over the competitors like a silent judge. In the center of the arena stood a massive anvil, half again the size of Corman himself.

The tension in the room was palpable as the party took in the scene. Thalrok, ever the instigator, locked eyes with Miranda, one of the other competitors. With a slow, deliberate gesture, he dragged his thumb across his throat in a silent threat. Miranda’s eyes narrowed, and for a moment, Thalrok felt a strange warmth in his mind, as if she were trying to influence him psychically. But like the cold winds of his mountain home, the sensation passed, and Thalrok shook it off with a smirk. Miranda had tried to mess with him, but she had failed.

Corman, oblivious to the psychic battle that had just taken place, made his rounds among the party. He approached Eirik first, shaking his hand firmly. "For the Lord’s Alliance, for Lathander," he said, his voice filled with determination. Eirik, ever the stoic, mumbled a half-hearted reply, but there was a glimmer of respect in his eyes. Next, Corman turned to Bog, who slapped his shoulders and biceps like a boxing coach hyping up his fighter. "You got this," Bog said, his voice filled with encouragement. "Show Miranda up. We need to put her in her place."

Finally, Corman approached Nitya. "Sorry for back there," he said, his voice softer now. "I was just getting a little heated. I don’t think we would’ve made it through the last event without your magic. You’re a valuable part of the team, and I can respect our differences." Nitya, ever the pragmatist, gave him a curt nod. "Good luck, young man," she replied, her familiar nuzzling Corman’s hand in a rare show of affection. Corman couldn’t help but smile as he gave the creature a playful scratch behind the ears.

With his team’s support behind him, Corman approached the massive anvil in the center of the arena. He pushed on it, testing its weight, but it was fixed firmly to the ground. He had no idea what he was supposed to do with it, but that didn’t matter. He was ready.

As the rest of the party made their way to the spectator area, Bog was momentarily stopped by one of the undead guards, who seemed to hesitate before letting him pass. Bog, ever the cheeky satyr, gave the undead a chin nod, as if to say, "Keep talking." The undead retreated, and Bog continued on his way, unbothered by the strange encounter.

The competition was about to begin, and Corman stood at the ready. His muscles were primed, his mind focused, and his team was behind him. The Feats of Strength were his domain, and he was determined to show everyone—Miranda, the other competitors, and even his own party—how winning was done.

As the ghostly tally keeper raised its hand to signal the start of the competition, Corman took a deep breath. This was his moment.

The tension in the air was palpable as Corman prepared for the Feats of Strength, the next grueling trial in the Thayan Games. The rest of the party—Eirik, Thalrok, Bog, Nitya, and Henk—had taken their places in the viewing area, where they could observe the unfolding event. Above them, the ceiling of the room had opened up, revealing a massive display that showcased the competitors and the challenges they were about to face. The other Tharks, battle-worn and weary from their own trials, sat silently, their eyes fixed on the screen.

The Tally Keeper, a spectral figure draped in shadow, floated into the center of the room, holding aloft a large scroll. As the ancient parchment unfurled, the rules of the event were psionically projected into the minds of the competitors, ensuring that even those unfamiliar with the language of Thay could understand the task at hand. The Feats of Strength would be a race, a brutal test of endurance and willpower. Only the strongest would emerge victorious.

As the Tally Keeper's voice echoed in their minds, the party listened intently. The challenge was clear: competitors would need to lift a black obelisk three times, with each repetition growing heavier. Afterward, they would carry a fiery yoke to the feet of a massive golem, chained at the far end of the arena. Once the yoke was delivered, the competitor would need to pull the golem halfway across the arena using a thick chain. Only then would they be allowed to strike the anvil, a legendary feat that required immense strength. The first to crack the anvil would be awarded the coveted black obelisk, marking them as the victor of the Feats of Strength.

Corman, ever the competitor, was already limbering up, stretching his muscles and psyching himself up for the trial ahead. His lucky lifting shorts were on, and Thalrok had bolstered his strength with the druidic magic of *Enhance Ability*. His confidence was palpable, and he couldn't help but flex his muscles at Bog, who rolled his eyes in response. "You want to see how winning is done?" Corman quipped, his voice filled with bravado.

The rest of the party made their way to the spectator area, where they could watch the event unfold. The room was filled with other competitors—battle-worn and weary Tharks who had just survived their own trials. They sat in silence, their eyes fixed on the screen above, where the competitors for the Feats of Strength were now visible.

As the Tally Keeper began to explain the mechanics of the event, Eirik and Thalrok adjusted their positions to get a better view. The rules were simple but unforgiving: each round would represent a roll, and the competitors would need to rely on their strength and endurance to succeed. The yoke, the chain, and the anvil would all test their limits, and any failure would result in damage and a potential loss of momentum.

The Tally Keeper also introduced the Dice of Fate, a special mechanic that allowed the spectators to influence the outcome of the event. Each member of the party was granted two rolls of the Dice of Fate, which they could use to modify a competitor's roll—either to help Corman or hinder a rival. It was a powerful tool, but it had to be used wisely.

As the competitors lined up, Corman took his place at the starting line, his eyes fixed on the black obelisk before him. He could feel the weight of the task ahead, but he was ready. This was his domain, and he was determined to show everyone—his party, the other Tharks, and even the Tally Keeper—what he was capable of.

The ghostly tally keeper raised its hand, signaling the start of the competition. Corman took a deep breath, his muscles tensed, and his mind focused. This was it.

The first challenge was to lift the obelisk three times. Corman stepped forward, gripping the cold stone with both hands. With a grunt of effort, he hoisted the obelisk into the air, feeling the strain in his arms and legs. The first rep was manageable, but as he lowered the obelisk back to the ground, he could feel the weight increasing. The second rep was harder, his muscles burning with the effort, but he managed to lift it again. By the third rep, the obelisk was almost too heavy to lift, but Corman dug deep, summoning every ounce of strength he had. With a final roar, he lifted the obelisk for the third and final time, his body trembling with the effort.

The next challenge was the fiery yoke. Corman approached the burning metal, his heart pounding in his chest. He knew this would be a test of endurance as much as strength. He lifted the yoke onto his shoulders, feeling the heat sear through his armor. Each step was agony, the weight of the yoke pressing down on him as he made his way toward the golem. His muscles screamed in protest, but he kept moving, one foot in front of the other. The crowd watched in silence, their eyes fixed on the competitors as they struggled under the weight of the yoke.

Corman reached the golem, his body drenched in sweat. The next task was to pull the massive creature halfway across the arena using a thick, iron chain. His hands were raw from the effort, but he gripped the chain tightly, planting his feet and pulling with all his might. The golem resisted, its massive form barely budging, but Corman refused to give up. He pulled again, his muscles straining, and slowly, inch by inch, the golem began to move.

Finally, the last challenge: the anvil. Corman approached the massive block of iron, his body trembling with exhaustion. He knew this would be the hardest test yet. The strength required to crack the anvil was legendary, but Corman was determined. He raised his hammer, his hands shaking, and brought it down with all his might.

Would it be enough? Only time would tell.

The tension in the arena was nearly palpable as the competitors prepared for the Feats of Strength. Corman, the human paladin, stood among them, his muscles taut with anticipation. His lucky lifting shorts were on, and his body hummed with the divine power of Lathander, bolstered further by Thalrok’s druidic magic. This wasn’t just another competition for Corman—it was a chance to prove himself, to show the might of the Lord’s Alliance and his own strength in the face of adversity.

The ghostly Tally Keeper floated into the arena, its presence eerie and commanding. The rules of the challenge were clear: each competitor would need to lift a heavy black obelisk three times, each lift growing progressively more difficult. After completing the lifts, they would carry a fiery yoke to the feet of a massive golem chained at the far end of the arena. Once the yoke was delivered, the competitors would pull the golem halfway across the arena using a thick iron chain. The final task was to strike a massive anvil, a feat that required immense strength. The first to crack the anvil would be declared the victor.

As the Tally Keeper’s voice echoed in the minds of the competitors, Corman took a deep breath, his eyes narrowing in focus. He had been in tough competitions before, but this was different. This was the Thayan Games, and the stakes were higher than ever.

The other competitors stood ready, each sizing up the obelisks before them. Among them was Miranda, a fierce rival whose psychic abilities had already made an impression on Thalrok. She stood poised, her eyes flickering with determination. Jorik, the orc from Garros, and a few others also prepared themselves, their muscles flexing in anticipation. But Corman paid them no mind—his focus was entirely on the task ahead.

With a nod from the Tally Keeper, the competition began. One by one, the competitors attempted their first lift. Miranda gritted her teeth, barely managing to hoist the obelisk above her head. Jorik, on the other hand, lifted his with ease, his orcish strength on full display. The dwarf struggled, failing to complete his first rep.

Corman, however, was in his element. He approached the obelisk, his hands coated in the lifting chalk that Thalrok had given him. With a grunt of effort, he powered through the first lift, hoisting the obelisk to his chest in a show of dominance before dropping it back down. The second rep was harder, but Corman closed his eyes, thinking about how fortunate he was not to be lifting something far worse in this hellish place. With a roar, he completed the second rep, his muscles straining but holding strong.

Meanwhile, the rest of the party watched from the stands, their eyes fixed on the competition. Henk, ever the strategist, decided to use his Dice of Fate to hinder Jorik, hoping to give Corman an edge. The dice rolled in Corman’s favor, and Jorik stumbled, his technique faltering as he lost his rhythm. The orc would have to skip his next turn, giving Corman a crucial advantage.

As the competition continued, Corman’s confidence grew. He completed his third rep with relative ease, his body trembling with the effort but his spirit unbroken. The dwarf, still struggling with the first rep, was falling behind, while Miranda faltered on her second attempt. The pressure was mounting, and the crowd could feel the tension rising.

The next phase of the challenge was the fiery yoke. Corman approached the burning metal, feeling the heat radiate through his armor as he hoisted it onto his shoulders. Each step was agony, the weight of the yoke pressing down on him as he made his way toward the chained golem. His muscles screamed in protest, but Corman pushed through, his mind focused on the task at hand. He reached the golem, his body drenched in sweat, and prepared for the next grueling task: pulling the massive creature across the arena.

Gripping the iron chain with both hands, Corman planted his feet and pulled with all his might. The golem resisted, its massive form barely budging, but Corman refused to give up. With a final, desperate heave, the golem began to move, inch by inch, as Corman dragged it halfway across the arena.

The final challenge loomed before him—the anvil. Corman approached the massive block of iron, his body trembling with exhaustion. He knew this would be the hardest test yet, but he was determined to succeed. Raising the hammer above his head, he brought it down with all his might, the sound of metal striking metal echoing through the arena.

As the dust settled, the crowd held its breath, waiting to see if Corman’s strike had been enough. The anvil shuddered but remained intact. Corman, his body pushed to its limits, prepared for another strike, knowing that victory was within his grasp.

The competition was far from over, but Corman had proven himself a force to be reckoned with. The other competitors, though formidable, were struggling to keep up. Miranda, Jorik, and the others watched in silent awe as Corman continued to push through each challenge, his determination unwavering.

The Feats of Strength had tested him, but Corman knew that he had more to give. With his party cheering him on from the stands, he prepared for the final push, knowing that the true test of his strength was yet to come.

The arena was a cacophony of noise, with the crowd buzzing in excitement as the Feats of Strength continued to unfold. Corman stood at the forefront, having just completed his third lift of the black obelisk. His body trembled with exertion, but his spirit was invigorated by the sight of his competitors faltering. He knew that good would triumph over evil, and in this moment, it seemed that his faith in Lathander was being rewarded.

Jorik, the orcish competitor, roared as he hoisted his obelisk, muscles bulging with the effort. He had struggled before, but now he seemed to find his rhythm, moving toward the next phase of the challenge. The Tiefling from Thaymount, however, was not so lucky. He buckled under the weight of the obelisk, his body giving out just inches from completing his third rep. Miranda, the psychic rival who had been a thorn in Thalrok’s side, tried again, her face twisted in concentration. For a brief moment, she seemed to see success within her grasp, but it slipped away as her body gave out, her skin simmering from the strain.

Corman, seeing his competition falter, felt a surge of energy. He was the first to complete the third rep and now stood before the fiery yoke. The yoke, a massive, burning contraption, represented the next grueling test. Corman gripped the chains on either side, positioning his large hands where the metal was cool enough to touch. With a grunt, he lifted the yoke, feeling the heat radiate through his armor. The weight was immense, but Corman was no stranger to hardship. He began his slow, deliberate march toward the chained golem at the far end of the arena.

The Gamemaster’s voice echoed through the arena, narrating the progress of the other competitors. Jorik, after a brief pause, easily completed his third lift and rushed toward one of the remaining yokes. The Tiefling, though exhausted, managed to muster the strength to lift his obelisk and make his way toward the yokes as well. Miranda, however, was still struggling, her vision of success slipping further away with each failed attempt. She growled in frustration, her body clearly reaching its limit.

Bog, watching from the spectator area, let out a sarcastic laugh at Miranda’s misfortune. "That’s what you get," he muttered under his breath, earning a chuckle from Thalrok. The druid, ever the strategist, was keeping a close eye on the competition, ready to offer his support to Corman if needed. Henk, meanwhile, sat quietly, petting Nitya’s hyena familiar as the tension in the arena grew.

As Corman continued his march with the yoke, the Gamemaster explained the next phase of the challenge. For every ten feet a competitor moved with the yoke, they would need to make a Constitution saving throw to avoid dropping it. Corman, determined to maintain his lead, pushed forward. His muscles screamed in protest, but he managed to keep his pace steady, avoiding the need for additional saving throws. He could feel the heat from the yoke searing through his armor, but he pressed on, his eyes locked on the chained golem ahead.

Jorik, now carrying his own yoke, was not far behind. The orc moved with surprising speed, his powerful legs propelling him forward. The Tiefling, though slower, was making steady progress, his face contorted in concentration as he fought to stay in the race. Miranda, after what seemed like an eternity, finally managed to lift her obelisk and began her march toward the yokes, though it was clear she was lagging behind the others.

As Corman reached the golem, he dropped the yoke with a heavy thud and turned his attention to the next task: pulling the massive creature halfway across the arena. The golem, a towering figure of stone and metal, was chained to the ground, its weight immense. Corman gripped the thick iron chain, his hands raw from the effort, and planted his feet. With a deep breath, he pulled.

The golem resisted, its massive form barely moving at first. But Corman, fueled by the cheers of the crowd and the support of his comrades, refused to give up. He pulled again, his muscles straining, and slowly, inch by inch, the golem began to move. The effort was immense, but Corman’s determination was unmatched. He could feel the weight of the chain digging into his hands, but he pushed through the pain, knowing that victory was within his grasp.

As Corman dragged the golem across the arena, the other competitors were still struggling to catch up. Jorik, though powerful, was beginning to show signs of fatigue, his movements slowing as he carried the yoke. The Tiefling, though determined, was clearly outmatched, his body trembling with the effort. Miranda, still far behind, was desperately trying to make up for lost time, but it was clear that her chances of winning were slipping away.

Finally, Corman reached the halfway point and dropped the chain. His body was trembling with exhaustion, but the final task remained: striking the anvil. The massive block of iron stood before him, a symbol of the strength required to win the Feats of Strength. Corman approached the anvil, his hammer in hand, and raised it high above his head.

With a roar, he brought the hammer down with all his might. The sound of metal striking metal echoed through the arena, and for a moment, the crowd held its breath. The anvil shuddered but remained intact.

Corman, his body pushed to its limits, prepared for another strike. Victory was so close he could taste it, but he knew that the final push would require every ounce of strength he had left.

The Feats of Strength had tested him in ways he had never imagined, but Corman was determined to emerge victorious. With his party cheering him on from the stands, he raised his hammer once more, ready to deliver the final blow.

The arena was alive with tension, the crowd murmuring in anticipation as the competitors struggled through the grueling Feats of Strength. Corman, the human paladin of the Lord’s Alliance, stood among them, his body trembling from the effort of lifting the black obelisk three times. He had pushed himself to the limit, and now the next phase of the challenge loomed before him—the fiery yoke and the chained golem.

Jorik, the orc competitor, had just surged ahead, moving with surprising speed despite the weight of the yoke on his shoulders. Corman watched as Jorik powered through, his muscles bulging as he carried the flaming burden across the arena. The orc was a force to be reckoned with, and Corman knew he had to dig deep if he wanted to keep pace.

"Should I speed up? Should I stay steady?" Corman muttered to himself, glancing up at the sky as if seeking guidance from his companions. The pressure was mounting, and he could feel his competitive nature bubbling to the surface. He had always been driven by the need to prove himself, but now, in the heart of the Thayan Games, that drive was being tested like never before.

From the stands, Eirik Thorne, the human fighter, called out, "You should walk, dude! Slow and steady wins the race." Bog, the satyr monk, chimed in with a grin, "Be eternal, Corman!" Their words of encouragement echoed in Corman’s mind as he hoisted the fiery yoke onto his shoulders, his muscles screaming in protest. The weight was immense, and the heat from the flames seared through his armor, but Corman pressed on, determined to keep moving forward.

He took his first steps, the yoke digging into his shoulders as he trudged across the arena. The Gamemaster’s voice rang out, reminding the competitors that for every ten feet they moved, they would need to make a Constitution saving throw. Corman gritted his teeth, knowing that each step could be his undoing. He moved cautiously, trying to maintain his balance, but his competitive nature got the better of him. He pushed forward, eager to close the gap between himself and Jorik, but the strain was too much. His body faltered, and with a grunt of frustration, he dropped the yoke.

The yoke hit the ground with a resounding clang, sending a gout of flame into the air. Corman winced as the flames licked at his skin, the heat scorching his arms. He had barely made it ten feet, and now he had to start again. The crowd gasped as they watched his progress falter, and Corman cursed himself under his breath. "What were you thinking?" he muttered, lifting the yoke once more. This time, he resolved to be more cautious.

Meanwhile, Jorik continued to surge ahead, his orcish strength propelling him forward. The Gamemaster narrated his progress, noting that Jorik had managed to move a full twenty feet without dropping the yoke. The orc’s determination was clear, and Corman felt the pressure mounting as he struggled to keep up.

As Corman prepared to move again, Henk Blackspear, the orc politician, called out from the stands, "You should run all the way and just use our dice on you if you feel like it!" The party had been granted the ability to influence the outcome of the competition through the Dice of Fate, and Henk was eager to see Corman succeed. But Corman knew that rushing headlong into the challenge would only lead to more mistakes.

He steadied himself, taking a deep breath before lifting the yoke once more. His legs shook with the effort, his muscles trembling as he forced himself to move forward. The yoke was heavy, but Corman was determined. He took another step, and then another, each one bringing him closer to the chained golem at the far end of the arena.

But just as he began to find his rhythm, disaster struck. Corman stumbled, the weight of the yoke overwhelming him once again. He dropped it for a second time, the flames scorching his skin as the yoke hit the ground. The crowd groaned, and Corman cursed under his breath, feeling the sting of failure. He had barely made any progress, and now he was falling behind.

Jorik, on the other hand, was making steady progress. The orc had moved a full thirty feet with the yoke, his powerful legs carrying him across the arena with ease. The Tiefling competitor, Kavrek Thull, was also making headway, though his movements were slower and more deliberate. Miranda, the psychic rival who had been struggling since the beginning, was still lagging behind, unable to lift the yoke at all. The competition was fierce, and Corman knew he couldn’t afford any more mistakes.

With a deep breath, Corman hoisted the yoke once more, his body trembling from the effort. He could feel the eyes of his companions on him, their silent encouragement pushing him forward. He took another step, and then another, each one bringing him closer to his goal. His legs burned with the effort, but he refused to give up. He would not be defeated.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Corman reached the golem. He dropped the yoke with a heavy thud, his body drenched in sweat. The next task was to pull the massive creature halfway across the arena using a thick iron chain. His hands were raw from the effort, but Corman gripped the chain tightly, planting his feet and pulling with all his might.

The golem resisted, its massive form barely budging at first. But Corman, fueled by the cheers of the crowd and the support of his comrades, refused to give up. He pulled again, his muscles straining, and slowly, inch by inch, the golem began to move. He could feel the weight of the chain digging into his hands, but he pushed through the pain, knowing that victory was within his grasp.

As Corman dragged the golem across the arena, the other competitors were still struggling to catch up. Jorik, though powerful, was beginning to show signs of fatigue, and the Tiefling was clearly outmatched. Miranda, still far behind, was desperately trying to make up for lost time, but it was clear that her chances of winning were slipping away.

Finally, Corman reached the halfway point and dropped the chain. His body was trembling with exhaustion, but the final task remained: striking the anvil. He approached the massive block of iron, his hammer in hand, and raised it high above his head. This was it—the moment of truth.

With a roar, Corman brought the hammer down with all his might. The sound of metal striking metal echoed through the arena, and for a moment, the crowd held its breath. The anvil shuddered but remained intact.

Corman, his body pushed to its limits, prepared for another strike. Victory was so close he could taste it, but he knew that the final push would require every ounce of strength he had left.

With his party cheering him on from the stands, Corman raised his hammer once more, ready to deliver the final blow.

The Feats of Strength had become a brutal, drawn-out contest of endurance, and the competitors were nearing their breaking points. Corman, the human paladin, had fought tooth and nail to stay in the race, but the task of carrying the fiery yoke had proven far more difficult than anticipated. He had dropped the yoke multiple times, each failure singeing his skin and sapping his strength. His frustration was palpable, and the crowd could sense the tension as he struggled to keep pace with the other competitors.

Jorik, the orcish powerhouse, had surged ahead, his natural strength allowing him to carry the yoke with relative ease. He was now neck and neck with Corman, both of them pushing their limits to reach the chained golem. The Tiefling competitor, Kavrek Thull, was lagging behind, unable to match the raw power of the others. Miranda, the psychic rival who had tried to outwit her competition, was all but eliminated from the contest, her body unable to keep up with the physical demands of the challenge.

As Corman lifted the yoke once more, he heard the cheers of his companions from the stands. Eirik Thorne, the human fighter, shouted words of encouragement, while Bog, the satyr monk, let out a wheezing laugh, clearly entertained by the sight of the competitors struggling and dropping their burdens. "Sides hurt!" Bog managed to gasp between fits of laughter, watching as strong men fumbled their way through the challenge.

Corman gritted his teeth, determined to push forward. He had fallen behind, but he wasn’t out of the race yet. He lifted the yoke onto his shoulders and began to move, his muscles screaming in protest. He could feel the heat of the flames licking at his skin, but he forced himself to keep going, one agonizing step at a time.

But then, disaster struck. Corman, in his haste to catch up, stumbled. The yoke slipped from his shoulders and crashed to the ground with a resounding clang, sending a burst of flame into the air. His body was singed again, and the heat seared through his armor. He cursed under his breath, knowing that every second lost was a chance for Jorik to pull ahead.

Jorik, sensing an opportunity, hoisted his yoke once more and began to move with purpose. The orc was a force of nature, his powerful legs propelling him forward with ease. He moved 20 feet without faltering, the flames barely seeming to affect him. The crowd watched in awe as Jorik powered through the challenge, his eyes fixed on the chained golem ahead.

Meanwhile, the other competitors were struggling. Kavrek Thull, the Tiefling, attempted to lift the yoke but was unable to do so. Miranda, still lagging far behind, had all but given up, her psychic abilities proving useless in the face of such a physically demanding challenge. The dwarf competitor, seeing an opportunity to catch up, managed to lift his yoke and moved 20 feet before dropping it, his body trembling from the effort.

Corman, seeing Jorik pull ahead, knew he had to act fast. He hoisted the yoke once more, his body trembling with exhaustion. He moved cautiously, determined not to drop it again. He managed to cover 10 feet before the weight became too much, and once again, the yoke slipped from his grasp. The flames singed his skin, and Corman cursed himself for his missteps.

The Gamemaster’s voice rang out, narrating the progress of the competitors. Jorik had reached the golem and was now preparing to pull the massive creature across the arena. The orc gripped the thick iron chain with both hands and began to pull, his muscles bulging with the effort. The golem resisted at first, but Jorik’s sheer strength proved too much, and the massive creature began to move.

Corman, despite his setbacks, wasn’t ready to give up. He lifted the yoke one final time and made his way to the golem, dropping the burden with a heavy thud. His body was trembling from the effort, but the next task lay before him: pulling the golem. He gripped the chain, his hands raw and blistered, and planted his feet. With a deep breath, he pulled.

The golem resisted, its massive form barely budging. But Corman, fueled by the cheers of his companions and his own determination, refused to quit. He pulled again, his muscles straining, and slowly, inch by inch, the golem began to move. The weight of the chain dug into his hands, but he pushed through the pain, knowing that victory was still within reach.

Jorik, having already moved the golem halfway across the arena, rushed toward the anvil, the final challenge of the Feats of Strength. The orc gripped the hammer and raised it high above his head, ready to deliver the final blow. But Corman wasn’t far behind. He had managed to pull the golem to the halfway point and now stood before the anvil, his body trembling with exhaustion.

With a roar, Jorik brought the hammer down onto the anvil, the sound of metal striking metal echoing through the arena. The anvil shuddered but remained intact. Corman, seeing his chance, raised his own hammer and swung with all his might. The crowd held its breath as the two competitors battled for supremacy, each strike bringing them closer to victory.

The Feats of Strength had pushed them to their limits, but Corman wasn’t ready to give up. With his party cheering him on from the stands, he prepared for one final strike, knowing that this could be the blow that decided the contest.

Would it be enough? Only time would tell.

The Feats of Strength had reached a fever pitch, with Corman, the human paladin, locked in a grueling contest that tested not only his strength but his endurance and resolve. The arena was alive with the sounds of clanging metal, the grunts of competitors, and the murmurs of the crowd, all eyes fixed on the remaining few who had managed to make it this far. Corman had pushed himself to the brink, his muscles straining under the weight of the fiery yoke, and his skin singed from repeated failures. But despite the setbacks, he pressed on, fueled by the cheers of his comrades and his unwavering faith in Lathander.

Jorik, the orcish competitor, had proven to be a formidable rival. His raw strength had allowed him to surge ahead, and he was now pulling the massive golem across the arena, his muscles bulging with effort. Corman, having dropped the yoke multiple times, knew he was behind, but he refused to let that deter him. With a deep breath, he hoisted the yoke once more and marched forward, determined to catch up.

The rest of the party watched from the stands, their eyes glued to the unfolding drama. Eirik Thorne, the human fighter, offered words of encouragement, while Bog, the satyr monk, couldn't help but laugh at the spectacle. "Sides hurt!" Bog wheezed, clearly entertained by the sight of the competitors struggling under the weight of the yoke. Thalrok, the goliath druid, and Henk Blackspear, the orc politician, kept a close eye on the competition, ready to offer their support through the Dice of Fate if needed.

As Corman finally reached the golem, he dropped the yoke with a heavy thud, his body trembling from the effort. The next task was to pull the massive creature halfway across the arena using a thick iron chain. Jorik had already made significant progress, but Corman was determined to close the gap. He gripped the chain tightly, his hands raw and blistered, and planted his feet. With a grunt of effort, he pulled.

The golem resisted, its massive form barely budging at first. But Corman, fueled by the cheers of the crowd and the support of his comrades, refused to give up. He pulled again, his muscles straining, and slowly, inch by inch, the golem began to move. The weight of the chain dug into his hands, but he pushed through the pain, knowing that victory was still within his grasp.

As Corman dragged the golem across the arena, Jorik reached the final challenge: the anvil. The orc gripped the hammer and raised it high above his head, ready to deliver the final blow. But just as he was about to strike, something went wrong. Whether it was a matter of technique or sheer exhaustion, Jorik faltered. His strike landed awkwardly, and the reverberation of the blow sent shockwaves through his body, causing him to take double damage. The crowd gasped as Jorik stumbled back, clearly shaken. Worse still, he would have to skip his next turn, giving Corman a crucial window of opportunity.

Seeing his chance, Corman paused for a moment, offering a silent prayer to Lathander. He could feel the divine power of his god coursing through him, filling him with renewed strength. With a deep breath, he gripped the chain once more and gave it a confident yank. The golem, which had resisted so fiercely before, now seemed to yield to Corman’s will. With a single, powerful pull, Corman brought the golem crashing to the ground, its massive form collapsing in a heap.

The other competitors, still struggling to pull the golem, could only watch in disbelief as Corman surged ahead. He had done the impossible—he had brought the golem down, effectively ending the race for anyone else. But Corman wasn’t done yet. With a grin, he performed a handstand on the back of the fallen golem, flipping off its massive form with a perfect landing in front of the anvil.

The crowd held its breath as Corman raised the hammer high above his head. This was the moment of truth—the final blow that would determine the victor of the Feats of Strength. With a roar, Corman brought the hammer down with all his might. The sound of metal striking metal echoed through the arena, and for a moment, time seemed to stand still.

Then, with a resounding crack, the anvil split in two.

The crowd erupted into a mix of cheers and gasps as Corman stood victorious, the first competitor to claim the black obelisk. He hoisted the obelisk high into the air, his voice ringing out across the arena. "Glory to Lathander! Glory to the Lord's Alliance!" This was, without a doubt, the most glorious moment of his life.

The atmosphere in the arena was strangely sullen, though. While Corman’s victory was undeniable, there was an undercurrent of tension. The other competitors, especially Jorik, were clearly frustrated by their losses. Respect, envy, and perhaps even a sense of foreboding filled the air. Corman had won, but in doing so, he had painted a target on his back.

As the crowd began to disperse, the rest of the party made their way to the next event: the Necromantic Rites. The large viewing portal at the top of the arena disappeared, and the group moved wordlessly toward a different room, knowing that Nitya, the human wizard, would be their representative for the next challenge.

Before she entered the portal, Corman approached Nitya. "Thank you," he said, his voice filled with genuine gratitude. Nitya nodded in acknowledgment, her familiar nuzzling against Corman’s hand in a rare show of affection. The moment was brief, as the competitors for the Necromantic Rites quickly moved into the portal, disappearing from sight.

The Feats of Strength had concluded, but the Thayan Games were far from over. The next challenge awaited, and the party knew that they would need every ounce of strength and cunning to survive what was to come.

As the dust from the Feats of Strength settled, the party gathered around Nitya, the human wizard, who was preparing for the next trial: the Necromantic Rites. Corman, still basking in the glory of his victory, approached her with a grin. "Hey, knock them dead out there," he said, his voice filled with confidence and camaraderie. Henk, the orc politician, cocked her head at the comment, a smirk tugging at the corner of her mouth. "Was that a joke?" she asked, her tone dripping with dry humor. Nitya, ever the pragmatist, simply nodded, her eyes focused on the task ahead. She motioned for her familiar, the hyena, to stay behind with Corman. The creature barked and bristled at the command but obediently remained at the paladin’s side.

With a final glance at her companions, Nitya stepped through the portal that would lead her to the Necromantic Rites. The air around her shimmered, and in an instant, she was transported to a dark and foreboding crypt, deep within the heart of Thay. The heavy scent of decay filled her nostrils, and the flickering light of candles cast eerie shadows on the stone walls. Ritual artists, their faces obscured by dark hoods, moved silently around her, setting up the arcane symbols and preparing the rites for what was to come.

As Nitya took in her surroundings, she noticed the other competitors beginning to orient themselves within the crypt. Each of them carried an air of grim determination, their eyes flickering with the knowledge that this trial would test not only their magical prowess but their very connection to the forces of life and death. Before them stood the prizes for this event: the bone laurel, the black obelisk, and the crimson scarab, each representing a different level of achievement in the Necromantic Rites. But these were not the only things that awaited them.

A host of creatures, twisted and undead, hovered at the edges of the crypt, their hollow eyes watching the competitors with a hunger that spoke of their eternal torment. Nitya could feel the weight of their gaze, the cold fingers of death brushing against her skin. This was not a simple contest of skill; this was a trial of survival, where the dead would rise to challenge the living.

She steeled herself, her mind racing as she considered the challenges ahead. The stench of death hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the stakes. This was Thay—where necromancy reigned supreme, and the line between life and death was as thin as a whisper. Nitya was no stranger to the dark arts, but she knew that the Necromantic Rites would push her to her limits. She had seen Corman prove his worth in the Feats of Strength, and now it was her turn to show the Lord’s Alliance what she was made of.

The other competitors began to move, each preparing their own spells and rituals. Nitya’s fingers brushed against the pages of her spellbook, her mind already working through the incantations she would need. The creatures in the crypt shifted, restless and eager for the rites to begin. She could feel the pulse of dark magic in the air, the very walls of the crypt thrumming with the power of the dead.

As the ritual artists completed their preparations, the Gamemaster’s voice echoed through the crypt, announcing the beginning of the Necromantic Rites. The challenge was clear: each competitor would need to summon and control the undead, bending them to their will in a series of trials that would test their mastery over life and death. Only the strongest necromancers would emerge victorious, and the rewards were great. The bone laurel, the black obelisk, and the crimson scarab were within reach, but only for those who could prove their worth.

Nitya’s heart raced as she stepped forward, her eyes locked on the creatures before her. This was her chance to prove herself, to show that she was just as capable as Corman, if not more so. The Lord’s Alliance had already secured one victory in the Thayan Games, and now they had the opportunity to take the lead in the medal count going into the second day of the competition.

The crypt was silent, save for the soft rustle of robes and the faint crackle of the candles. Nitya could feel the weight of her companions’ expectations, even from afar. They were watching, waiting to see if she could rise to the challenge. She took a deep breath, her fingers tightening around her spellbook.

The Necromantic Rites had begun.

In the shadows, the undead stirred, their hollow eyes glowing with a malevolent light. Nitya’s pulse quickened as she began to chant the words of power, her voice steady and unwavering. The air around her shimmered with dark energy, and the stench of death grew stronger. This was her moment—her chance to prove her worth in the Thayan Games.

And she would not fail.

As the first day of the Thayan Games drew to a close, the Lord’s Alliance stood on the brink of victory. Corman had secured their first medal in the Feats of Strength, and now Nitya had the chance to lead them to even greater glory in the Necromantic Rites. The second day loomed ahead, filled with even more challenges and dangers, but for now, the party could rest knowing they had fought well.

The Thayan Games were far from over, but the Lord’s Alliance had already made their mark.

And the best was yet to come.
