The sun had barely risen over the city of Lesvath when the adventurers awoke to grim news. Henk Blackspear, their orcish companion, had vanished in the night, taken by a succubus, presumably a member of another Thark competing in the Thayan Games. The Thayan Inquisition, known as the Probity Corps, had attempted to wipe the memory of this event from the group, but only Thalrok, the Goliath druid, had managed to resist the enchantment. He alone remembered what had transpired. The rest of the group was left with a vague sense of unease, knowing something was wrong but unable to recall the specifics.

The day before had been no less troubling. A cryptic encounter at the Nameless Tavern had led Bog, the satyr monk, down a path of mystery, while a skirmish in a dark alley had left the group wary of unseen enemies. Now, with the first events of the Thayan Games looming, the party—Bog, Eirik, Thalrok, and Corman—decided to follow a signal from one of their message stones brought from Waterdeep. It was time to leave the barracks known as the Pit of Eternal Servitude and venture westward, out of the city.

As they walked through the mage district, the streets were noticeably crowded, filled with humans and the occasional undead servant, their hollow eyes reflecting the will of the Red Wizards who ruled this land. The farther they ventured from the heart of the city, the more the landscape changed. The mage district, with its arcane wonders, gave way to the outskirts, where squalor and despair reigned. Peasants and laborers shuffled through the streets, their eyes downcast, as if afraid to meet the gaze of anyone who might be watching.

Eirik, ever vigilant, scanned the alleys and crowds for any sign of danger—particularly the Darakul, the ghoul-like creatures that had marked them for reasons still unclear. Though he saw no Darakul, he did notice variations of undead, some performing menial tasks, others acting as guards. Corman, the human paladin, was less concerned with the undead and more focused on finding Henk. He was confident that his friend was still alive, perhaps wandering the streets after a rough night of drinking. But as they passed through the west gate and left the city behind, even Corman’s hope began to wane.

The desert outside the city was unlike any they had encountered before. The sand sparkled faintly, as if touched by magic, and the air felt heavy with enchantment. Thalrok, no stranger to the wilderness, found the landscape foreign and unsettling. A minor sandstorm had begun to swirl around them, the wind whipping grains of sand into their faces as they trudged forward. Ahead, through the haze, they could make out the vague outline of a weathered stone tower perched atop a rocky cliff. It was their destination, the source of the signal that had drawn them out into the desert.

But before they could reach the tower, their path was blocked by a strange sight. A lone wanderer, leading a large camel, trudged through the sand. Behind him, several half-clothed human slaves, barefoot and exhausted, followed in a slow, painful march. Their heads were bowed, their eyes fixed on the ground, as if the weight of their servitude had crushed any hope of escape.

Corman’s eyes narrowed as he took in the scene. "We’ve got to do something," he muttered, glancing at Thalrok. "No one deserves to live like this."

Thalrok nodded in agreement, his massive frame tense with barely restrained anger. "Let’s confront him," the druid growled.

Before they could act, Eirik waved his arm dismissively. "We don’t have time for this. We’re on a mission."

Bog, ever the pragmatist, nodded in agreement. "It bogs us down," the satyr said, his voice tinged with impatience.

But Corman was not so easily swayed. "There’s always time to do what’s right," he declared, stepping forward to block the wanderer’s path. He raised a hand, trying to get the man’s attention. "Hey! Stop!"

The wanderer didn’t even glance in Corman’s direction. He continued to trudge forward, his eyes fixed on the horizon. The slaves, too, remained silent, their faces blank, their bodies moving as if on autopilot. It was clear they had been on a long and grueling journey, and whatever hope they once had was long gone.

Corman’s heart ached at the sight, but he knew there was little he could do in this moment. The desert stretched out before them, and the tower loomed in the distance, promising answers—or perhaps more questions. With a heavy sigh, he stepped aside, allowing the wanderer and his slaves to pass.

As the party resumed their march toward the tower, the ever-present feeling of being watched gnawed at them. It was as if invisible eyes followed their every move, recording their actions for some unknown purpose. The Probity Corps, no doubt, was keeping tabs on them, but the inconsistencies in their surveillance left the group uneasy. What were they missing? What dangers lurked just beyond their sight?

The sandstorm intensified as they approached the base of the cliff, the wind howling around them. The tower stood tall and foreboding, its weathered stone walls a stark contrast to the shifting sands below. Whatever awaited them inside, they knew it would not be easy. But they had come too far to turn back now.

With a final glance at each other, the adventurers steeled themselves for what lay ahead and began the climb.

The desert wind howled around them, carrying with it the scent of ancient magic and the weight of unseen eyes. The party had ventured far from the city, but the oppressive atmosphere of Thay still clung to them. Corman, the stalwart paladin, stood at the front, his eyes fixed on the wanderer leading a group of downtrodden slaves across the shifting sands. His heart ached at the sight, and his righteous indignation flared.

"We can’t just let this happen," Corman muttered, his hand tightening on the hilt of his sword. "These people are clearly captured. We know this is a land of evil, and we need to stop it."

Bog, ever the pragmatist, stepped forward, shaking his head. "I agree with you, Corman. But this is just a small pebble in a large pond. Stopping this one man won’t change anything. We have bigger things to deal with—like winning this competition. We’ll help more people that way."

Eirik, the human fighter, nodded in agreement. "What’s right is finding our friends and winning these games. Leave these slaves be."

But Corman was not so easily swayed. "There’s always time to do what’s right," he insisted. His eyes followed the wanderer and his slaves, who marched on, seemingly oblivious to the adventurers. Corman’s resolve hardened. He stepped forward, reaching into his pouch and pulling out nine gold pieces, offering them to the wanderer in a last-ditch effort to buy the slaves’ freedom. 

The wanderer, a cloaked Thayan man, glanced briefly at Corman before waving him off with a dismissive gesture, muttering something under his breath. The insult stung, but Corman wasn’t finished. "We’ll be seeing you around," he said, trying to sound menacing, though the man paid him no mind. 

As the group continued their march, one of the slaves stumbled and fell face-first into the sand. The others didn’t stop, didn’t even glance back. Corman’s eyes lit up with a flicker of hope. "See? It worked!" He rushed to the fallen slave, shaking him gently. "Can you hear me?" he asked, his voice filled with concern.

The slave stirred, his face rising from the sand as if waking from a deep sleep. But instead of gratitude or relief, the man’s eyes were wide with panic. He scrambled to his feet and sprinted after the others, desperate to rejoin them, as though some unseen force compelled him forward.

Bog sighed, watching the scene unfold. "I don’t think we could free these slaves even if we wanted to," he said, turning to Corman. "They’re under some kind of spell. But the group we met at the tavern—they might be able to help us free them in time. We can’t do it alone."

Corman’s shoulders slumped, the weight of his failure bearing down on him. He said nothing, his eyes downcast, but the fire in his heart dimmed. He knew Bog was right, but it didn’t make it any easier to accept.

Thalrok, the Goliath druid, broke the silence as the wind picked up, whipping sand into their faces. "We need to find the signal," he said, his voice a low rumble. The storm was getting worse, the dust swirling around them in chaotic gusts.

As they pressed on, Eirik suddenly felt the ground beneath him shift. The sand seemed to liquefy, swirling around his legs, dragging him down. His eyes widened in alarm as a vortex of sand formed around him, pulling him deeper into the desert.

"Something’s here!" he shouted, struggling to free himself.

Bog, quick on his feet, dashed forward, covering the distance in a blur of movement. He skidded to a halt in front of the swirling sand and, without hesitation, began swinging his fists into the vortex. His strikes connected with the strange, liquid-like substance, leaving visible impacts as the sand recoiled. It wasn’t just sand—it was something more, something alive.

"Looks like it’s taking damage," Bog muttered, his fists a blur as he continued his assault. He focused his energy, channeling his ki into a stunning strike. His fist slammed into the vortex, and for a moment, the swirling sand froze, the creature within momentarily stunned.

But as the vortex stilled, two more masses of sand began to form nearby, rising from the desert floor like waves preparing to crash down on the party. The situation was escalating fast.

Corman, breathing heavily in the thick desert air, charged forward as best as he could, though his heavy armor slowed him down. The sandstorm around him made it hard to see, and the unfamiliar terrain was disorienting. He thought of the peaceful village he had once called home, of the sun-drenched fields and clear skies. This desert was a nightmare by comparison.

"UNHAND HIM!" Corman bellowed as he hurled a javelin at the nearest sand creature. The weapon flew true, embedding itself in the swirling mass of sand, but the creature barely seemed to notice. 

The two new sand creatures surged forward, their forms shifting and collapsing like waves crashing over the dunes. The storm was intensifying, and the adventurers were now surrounded by these strange, living sand vortices. The battle had only just begun, and the odds were quickly turning against them.

But they had come too far to turn back now.

The desert wind howled, swirling the sands around the adventurers as they struggled against the strange, living vortexes of sand that had risen from the ground. Eirik Thorne, ever the fighter, gritted his teeth as he swung his mighty hammer, Gravebreaker, into the frozen mass of sand that had tried to drag him down. His weapon crashed into the swirling entity, sending shards of hardened sand flying in all directions. But even as the creature recoiled from the blow, Eirik's sharp mind was already racing ahead.

"We need to keep moving!" he shouted over the roar of the wind. His voice was strained, not just from the exertion of battle, but from the growing realization that these creatures might be endless. They had to reach the tower, or they could be stuck fighting these things forever. He swung again, Gravebreaker cutting through the air, and then, without waiting for the others, he began to move, his boots sinking into the shifting sands as he made his way toward what he believed was the entrance to the tower.

Thalrok, the Goliath druid, heard Eirik's call and nodded grimly. The towering figure of stone and muscle had never been one to shy away from a fight, but even he could sense the futility of battling these strange creatures in the open desert. With a quick incantation, he activated his Cloud Jaunt ability, teleporting himself across the battlefield, avoiding the grasping tendrils of sand that reached for him. He landed near Eirik, ready to continue the fight but also aware of the need to push forward.

Before moving further, Thalrok took a swing at the nearest sand vortex, his massive weapon crashing into the creature with a satisfying thud. The sand creature shuddered, its form momentarily disrupted, but it did not fall. Thalrok cursed under his breath and prepared to follow Eirik, but the sandstorm was growing fiercer, and the creatures seemed to be multiplying.

Meanwhile, Bog, the satyr monk, was in the thick of the fray. His fists had already pummeled one of the sand creatures into submission, the swirling mass collapsing into the desert floor as if it had never existed. But as he turned to disengage and follow the others, the ground beneath him gave way. In an instant, Bog found himself waist-deep in the sand, the grains clinging to him like quicksand. He struggled to free himself, but the more he fought, the more the sand seemed to pull him down.

"Thay, Thay, Thay," Bog muttered under his breath, the mantra becoming a curse as the sand began to eat away at his skin. It felt like thousands of tiny blades scraping against him, and he could feel the acidic burn of the sand as it began to seep through his clothes. Desperate, he lashed out with his fists, using his Flurry of Blows to strike at the sand creature that held him captive. His punches connected, but the creature seemed unfazed, its form shifting and reforming as if his attacks were nothing more than a mild inconvenience.

Corman, the human paladin, was huffing and puffing, his heavy armor making it difficult to move through the sandstorm. He had heard Eirik's call to keep moving, but the sight of Bog being swallowed by the sand gave him pause. He wanted to rush to his friend's aid, but the storm was making it hard to see, and the creatures were closing in. With a grunt of frustration, Corman pushed forward, using all his strength to dash through the difficult terrain. He made it a few dozen feet before he was forced to stop, the weight of his armor and the intensity of the storm slowing him down.

As Corman caught his breath, one of the sand creatures surged forward, its form shifting like a wave of water as it tried to envelop Thalrok. The Goliath barely managed to sidestep the attack, the creature's grasping tendrils missing him by inches. But Bog wasn't so lucky. The sand around him continued to churn, pulling him deeper into the ground. He could feel the sandpaper-like texture scraping against his skin, the acidic burn intensifying as it ate away at him. He gritted his teeth, determined to fight through the pain, but the situation was growing dire.

Eirik, seeing Bog's plight, spun around from his retreat toward the tower. His eyes narrowed as he saw the sand creature enveloping his friend. With a roar of fury, he raised Gravebreaker high above his head and brought it crashing down into the ground next to Bog. The hammer struck the sand with a thunderous impact, sending shockwaves through the creature. Eirik didn't stop there. He wheeled around, bringing Gravebreaker down again in a powerful backstroke, the weapon smashing into the creature with all the force he could muster.

The sand creature shuddered under the assault, its form destabilizing as Eirik's hammer struck again and again. It was like digging through solid rock, each blow sending cracks through the creature's form, but it wasn't enough to completely destroy it. The creature was resilient, its form shifting and reforming even as Eirik continued to hammer away at it.

"Hold on, Bog!" Eirik shouted, his voice barely audible over the roar of the wind and the grinding of sand. "We're not leaving you behind!"

Despite the chaos of the battle, the group knew they had to keep moving. The tower loomed in the distance, a shadowy figure barely visible through the storm. It was their only hope of escape, but the sand creatures were relentless, and the storm showed no signs of letting up. The adventurers were caught in a deadly dance with the desert itself, and it was unclear if they would make it out alive.

With the sandstorm intensifying and the creatures multiplying, the odds were stacked against them. But they had come too far to turn back now.

The swirling sands of the Thayan desert continued to churn violently around the adventurers, the storm intensifying with every passing moment. Eirik Thorne, the human fighter, gripped his hammer, Gravebreaker, tightly in his hands. With a mighty swing, he brought the weapon crashing down into the sand vortex that had ensnared him. The impact was like striking clay beneath the surface of the sand, the creature recoiling from the blow. Eirik could feel it weakening, but it wasn’t finished yet.

"Thay, Thay, Thay," Eirik muttered under his breath, the name of the cursed land becoming a mantra of frustration. With another surge of strength, he swung his hammer a second time, the force of the blow sending ripples through the sand creature. It began to fizzle, its form destabilizing, but it still clung stubbornly to life. Eirik’s breath came in ragged gasps as he ended his turn, hoping the others could finish it off.

Thalrok, the Goliath druid, inspired by Eirik’s relentless assault, swung his sickle at the creature. The blade bit into the sand, carving away at its edges, but the vortex continued to swirl, resisting their efforts to destroy it entirely. The sandstorm around them made it difficult to see, the wind whipping grains of sand into their faces as they fought to free themselves.

Nearby, Bog, the satyr monk, struggled against the churning sand that was pulling him deeper into the ground. Panic flickered in his mind as the sand clung to him, scraping against his skin like thousands of tiny blades. He gritted his teeth and tried to pull himself free, but the sand held him fast, dragging him further down. "God damn it, son of a bitch!" he cursed, his frustration mounting.

Despite his dire situation, Bog wasn’t ready to give up. He focused his energy, channeling his ki into a Flurry of Blows. His fists slammed into the sand, each strike a desperate attempt to free himself from the creature’s grasp. "Let me go!" he screamed, his voice barely audible over the roar of the storm. But the creature continued to pull him under, its form shifting and churning as it tightened its hold.

Corman, the human paladin, saw his friend’s plight and knew he had to act. "Bog, get down! Lathander will save you!" he called out, his voice filled with conviction. He sprinted toward the satyr, muttering a prayer under his breath as he drew his longsword. With a surge of divine energy, Corman invoked his Channel Divinity, casting **Inspiring Smite**. Holy light radiated from his blade as he struck the sand, sending waves of energy through the vortex and granting Bog 15 temporary hit points.

The sand creature recoiled from the divine energy, its form disrupted by the holy power. Corman swung his longsword again, but this time, his strike fell short. The sand shifted, dodging the blow, but Corman’s intervention had weakened it. "Hold on, Bog!" he shouted, his determination unwavering.

The sand creature, now desperate, lashed out at Thalrok, its primal hunger evident as it tried to pull the Goliath into its depths. Thalrok hesitated for a moment, and in that instant, the creature’s tendrils wrapped around him, dragging him chest-deep into the sand. "Eirik, finish it!" Thalrok called out, his voice strained as he struggled against the creature’s pull.

Eirik, seeing his companions in danger, summoned all his strength and charged toward the remaining sand creature. Gravebreaker swung through the air, connecting with the vortex that had ensnared Thalrok. The impact was devastating, and the creature’s form began to melt away, releasing its hold on the Goliath. Thalrok stumbled free, gasping for breath as the sand creature disintegrated.

Without hesitation, Eirik turned and rushed to Bog’s side. The satyr was still trapped, the sand creature gnawing at him with an almost sentient hunger. Eirik raised Gravebreaker once more and brought it crashing down into the sand. The creature shuddered, its form collapsing under the force of the blow, and finally, it too melted away.

The storm still raged around them, but the immediate threat had passed. The adventurers stood panting, their bodies battered and bruised from the battle. "We must hurry out of this storm," Eirik said, his voice urgent. "There’s no time to waste."

Bog staggered to his feet, brushing the sand from his legs. "It’s like the hair’s all gone off my legs," he muttered, trying to lighten the mood despite the pain he felt. Corman approached him, concern etched on his face. "Did you hear the voice of Lathander when you were blessed by his holy energy?" he asked, his tone serious.

Before Bog could respond, Thalrok and Eirik had already begun making their way toward the tower that loomed in the distance. The storm seemed to lessen as they approached, the howling wind dying down as they crossed the threshold into the ancient structure. Inside, the air was still, but the signs of a recent struggle were evident. Blood stained the stone floor, and weapons lay scattered about. Footprints, sheltered from the storm, marked the ground, telling the tale of a fierce battle that had taken place here.

Corman knelt down, examining the scene with a furrowed brow. "Something happened here," he said, his voice low. His investigation skills were lacking, but even he could tell that whatever had transpired had been violent.

As they moved deeper into the tower, they noticed small, rat-like humanoids skittering away from them, their beady eyes watching warily from the shadows. These creatures, no more than two or three feet tall, were armed with crude weapons but seemed more interested in avoiding conflict than starting one.

Thalrok, ever the diplomat, called out to them, hoping to establish some form of communication. But the creatures remained silent, their movements cautious as they kept their distance from the adventurers. Whatever these beings were, they were clearly intelligent, but whether they were friend or foe remained to be seen.

As the group pressed on, the weight of the desert battle still heavy on their minds, they knew that more dangers awaited them within the tower. The storm outside had been only the beginning.

The air inside the tower was thick with tension as the adventurers regrouped after their battle with the sand creatures. The storm outside continued to rage, but within the stone walls, the atmosphere was eerily still. Thalrok, the Goliath druid, took the lead, his booming voice filling the chamber as he attempted to communicate with the skittish rat-like humanoids that scurried about the room. "We mean you no harm," he called out, his voice echoing off the stone walls. "I just want to know what's going on here."

The rat creatures, startled by the sudden noise, froze for a moment before retreating further into the shadows. It was clear they were not in the mood for conversation, and Thalrok’s attempt at diplomacy fell on deaf ears. They were small, no more than two or three feet tall, with crude weapons drawn—tiny knives and slings that looked more like toys than tools of war. Yet their defensive posture around a large, swollen bag in the center of the room suggested that whatever they were guarding was of great importance.

Eirik Thorne, the human fighter, was less concerned with the rats and more focused on the room itself. His instincts, honed from years of crypt crawling and battle, told him that something was off. He approached the nearby door, his hands tracing the edges as he inspected it for traps. The wood was worn, and the door seemed recently used, but there were no obvious signs of mechanical traps. However, Eirik’s senses tingled as he detected a faint hum of arcane magic on the other side. "Thay, Thay, Thay," he muttered under his breath, his frustration with the cursed land growing with each passing moment. He jiggled the door handle, finding it loose but unlocked, and stepped back, waiting for the others to join him.

Thalrok glanced at the group, his massive frame casting a shadow over the room. "Let’s just do it," he said, his voice steady. He counted down from three, and as he reached one, Eirik swung the door open.

Inside, the sight that greeted them was both strange and unsettling. Suspended in the air, hovering several feet off the ground, was a middle-aged woman, her body frozen in a hunched pose. She was surrounded by a faint, glowing purple light, and even the sand particles around her seemed to be caught in time, frozen mid-air. Her clothing, her hair, everything about her was locked in place, as though she had been trapped in this moment for an eternity.

Eirik stepped closer, his eyes narrowing as he examined the magical aura around the woman. He had encountered arcane traps before, and this one seemed familiar. After a moment of concentration, he realized that the woman had likely been the victim of a powerful holding spell, either triggered by a trap or cast by someone else. Whatever had happened to her, it had taken place long ago, and there didn’t seem to be any immediate danger to the group. "She’s frozen," he said, his voice low. "But I don’t see a way to break her out, at least not yet."

Bog, the satyr monk, squinted at the woman, his mind racing. "Do you see anything that looks like the signal stone on her?" he asked, hoping that this mysterious figure might be connected to their quest. Eirik shook his head. There was no sign of the stone they sought.

Frustrated, Eirik turned his attention back to the rat creatures that had retreated into another room. "Maybe they know something," he mused, stepping back toward the doorway. "Or maybe they have a way to free her."

Bog, ever the pragmatist, pointed at Thalrok. "You know how to talk to rats, right?" he asked, half-joking but also half-serious. Thalrok gave him a withering look, but before he could respond, they heard movement from the other room. The rat creatures had gathered around the large bag, their tiny weapons drawn in a defensive stance. There were at least seven of them now, and they seemed ready to defend the bag with their lives.

Corman, the human paladin, was still in the previous room, turning over bricks in search of a hidden lever or switch. "There’s got to be something here," he muttered to himself, though his search yielded no results.

Thalrok, sensing the tension in the air, decided to try communicating with the rats once more. He approached them cautiously, using his ability to speak with animals. His voice took on a strange, almost mechanical tone as he attempted to mimic the sounds of the rats. Several of the creatures’ ears perked up at the sound, but they did not respond. Instead, they tightened their grip on their weapons, clearly unwilling to back down.

Bog, ever the jokester, chimed in. "Anyone got any cheese we can throw at them?" he quipped, though his tone was laced with genuine concern. "They’re not getting any of my beer."

Eirik, meanwhile, was trying to sense if the magic in the room was related to the arcane trap that had ensnared the woman. He could feel a faint magical aura emanating from the bag, but it was unclear if it was connected to the spell. "There’s something magical about that bag," he said, his voice tense. "But I can’t tell if it’s related to the trap."

Thalrok, growing impatient, decided to take a more direct approach. He straightened to his full height and boomed, "Put your weapons down before this gets ugly!" His voice echoed through the room, and for a moment, it seemed as though the rats might comply. Two of them, clearly terrified, bolted from the room, darting between the adventurers’ legs and disappearing into the desert beyond.

Bog, always quick on his feet, stuck out his leg and tripped one of the fleeing rats. The tiny creature tumbled to the ground with a squeak, scrambling to get back on its feet. "Thay, Thay, Thay," Bog muttered under his breath, shaking his head.

The remaining rats, however, stood their ground, weapons still drawn, their beady eyes fixed on the adventurers. Whatever was in that bag, they were willing to fight for it.

With tensions running high and the mystery of the frozen woman still unresolved, the adventurers knew they were standing on the precipice of a new confrontation. The rats were small, but their determination was fierce, and the magical aura surrounding the bag hinted at something far more dangerous than mere rodent guardianship. The next move would be critical, and the adventurers would need to decide quickly whether to fight, negotiate, or retreat.

The storm outside may have subsided, but inside the tower, a different kind of storm was brewing.

The tension in the tower grew as the adventurers faced off against the small rat-like creatures, their tiny hands gripping crude daggers with trembling determination. The air was thick with the scent of desperation, and the creatures seemed to know they were outmatched. Yet, despite their fear, they huddled together, clutching their swollen desert bag as if it were the last lifeboat in a stormy sea. Their beady eyes darted nervously between the towering figures of Thalrok, Eirik, Bog, and Corman, but their resolve to protect the bag remained steadfast.

Eirik Thorne, the human fighter, looked down at the rats and muttered under his breath, "Thay, Thay, Thay," a mantra that had become both a curse and a reflection of his growing frustration with this cursed land. He then pulled out a piece of leather armor, one he had taken from their missing companion, Henk. He pointed at the armor and then at the rats, before turning to Thalrok. "Tell them we’ll trade this for the bag."

Thalrok, the Goliath druid, stepped forward and translated Eirik’s offer. The rats, though they did not speak, seemed to understand. One of them, the bravest of the bunch, stepped forward and made a gesture with its tiny claws—a motion of give and take. The deal was clear: they would accept the armor in exchange for the bag.

Eirik handed over the leather armor, and the rat quickly stuffed it into the oversized bag. Thalrok, towering over the small creatures, reached down to take the bag. But as soon as his massive hands touched it, the rats erupted into a frenzy. Their fear turned into fury, and they lunged at the party, daggers drawn. "Roll for initiative," the Gamemaster declared, and the battle was on.

Eirik, quick to react, swung Gravebreaker at one of the rats, but the momentum of the swing caused him to miss, the hammer smashing into the bag instead. The rats shrieked in terror, their focus shifting to the bag as they swarmed around it, desperate to protect whatever was inside. Eirik, undeterred, brought Gravebreaker around in a backswing, this time connecting with one of the rats. The force of the blow sent the creature crumpling to the ground with a pitiful squeak, its tiny body limp.

The remaining rats hissed in fury, their eyes wild with panic. One of them darted forward, using its agility to slip through Thalrok’s legs. It made a beeline for Bog, the satyr monk, stabbing at his calf with a makeshift dagger. Bog felt the sharp sting of the blade and looked down at the tiny creature with a mixture of annoyance and amusement. "You little fucker," he muttered, preparing to retaliate.

Thalrok, seeing the chaos unfold, decided it was time to bring out the big guns. He raised his hands to the sky and summoned a storm cloud within the tower, the air crackling with electricity. With a shout of "Skystorm!" he called down a bolt of lightning that shot through the broken roof of the tower. The bolt struck the rats, instantly vaporizing one of them and badly singeing the others. The smell of burnt fur filled the air, and the rats shrieked in terror as the lightning crackled around them.

Bog, now fully engaged in the fight, grabbed the rat that had stabbed him, using his grappling skills to overpower the tiny creature. The rat struggled in his grasp, but Bog was too strong. With a smirk, he dragged the rat over to a nearby well and held it over the edge. "Let’s see how far down this goes," he said, and without hesitation, he dropped the rat into the darkness below. The creature let out a final squeak as it disappeared into the abyss.

Meanwhile, Corman, the human paladin, stood back, watching the chaos unfold. His heavy armor made it difficult for him to move quickly, but he was ready to intervene if necessary. He muttered a prayer to Lathander under his breath, hoping that divine intervention would not be needed in this battle.

The remaining rats, now reduced in number and morale, were clearly outmatched. Their earlier bravado had faded, replaced by sheer terror. They clung to the bag, but it was clear they wouldn’t be able to hold out much longer. Eirik, sensing their desperation, stepped forward, his hammer raised. "You’ve made a grave mistake," he said, his voice low and menacing.

The battle was nearing its end, but the adventurers knew that something more sinister lurked within the tower. The rats had been protecting the bag with a fervor that suggested it held something of great importance. As the last of the rat creatures fell, the party gathered around the bag, their curiosity piqued. What could be inside that was worth dying for?

Thalrok, still wary of the magical aura he had sensed earlier, reached down and opened the bag. Inside, they found not just the leather armor they had traded, but something far more valuable—a shimmering gemstone, pulsating with arcane energy. It was clear now why the rats had been so desperate to protect it.

As the storm outside began to die down, the adventurers exchanged glances. They had survived the battle, but the mystery of the gemstone and the tower was only just beginning to unravel. The rats had been mere pawns in a larger game, and the true danger still lay ahead.

With the gemstone in hand and the path forward uncertain, the adventurers prepared themselves for whatever challenges awaited them deeper within the tower. The storm may have passed, but the real storm—the one brewing within the heart of Thay—was far from over.

The storm outside the tower raged on, its fury muted by the thick stone walls that sheltered the adventurers. Inside, the battle against the rat-like creatures had reached a fever pitch. Eirik Thorne, his voice a low growl of frustration, swung his massive hammer, Gravebreaker, at one of the rats. The creature was small, nimble, and surprisingly quick, dodging the hammer’s first swing with a terrified squeak. Eirik, his patience wearing thin, swung again, this time putting all his strength into the blow. The hammer crashed into the ground, sending up a cloud of dust and sand, but once again, the rat managed to evade the attack. Its tiny eyes darted between Eirik and the others, clearly aware that its chances of survival were slim.

Nearby, Bog, the satyr monk, had his own hands full. One of the rats had managed to slip through the chaos and stab at his leg with a makeshift dagger. The blade barely made a dent, but it was enough to irritate him. "You little fucker," Bog muttered, his voice tinged with both annoyance and amusement. With a swift motion, he grabbed the rat and, without hesitation, hurled it into the nearby well. The creature let out a final squeak as it disappeared into the darkness below. There was a distant crunch as it hit the bottom, and Bog, satisfied with his work, stepped back toward the rest of the party. "That takes care of that," he said, brushing the sand from his hands.

Corman, the human paladin, watched the scene unfold with a mixture of amusement and nostalgia. The sight of Bog tossing the rat into the well reminded him of the friendly competitions of his youth, where he had honed his skill with javelins. With a smirk, he pulled out one of his own javelins and, in a single fluid motion, hurled it at another rat that was trying to escape. The javelin flew true, pinning the creature to the side of the well with a sickening thud. Corman clenched his fist in a self-congratulatory motion. "Still got it," he muttered to himself, a small smile playing on his lips.

Thalrok, the Goliath druid, had been watching the battle unfold with a calm, calculating eye. As the rats scattered, one of them tried to make a desperate escape, darting toward the well in an attempt to save its fallen comrade. But Thalrok had other plans. With a single motion, he raised his hand to the sky, calling upon the power of the storm. A bolt of lightning tore through the air, striking the rat squarely in the chest. The creature was thrown against the side of the tower, its body a smoking, crumpled heap. The smell of burnt fur filled the air, mixing with the acrid scent of the storm outside. Thalrok lowered his hand, satisfied with the result. "Skystorm," he muttered under his breath, the name of his signature spell.

With the last of the rats dispatched, the adventurers turned their attention to the bag the creatures had been guarding so fiercely. Eirik, ever the pragmatist, was the first to approach. He knelt down and began rummaging through the contents, pulling out a variety of strange and seemingly random items: old canvases, spices, and even a few infant ratmen. "There’s a lot of stuff in here," Eirik said, his voice tinged with curiosity. He continued to sift through the bag, pulling out a mysterious dagger, some gold, and a stone carved with strange symbols. "This is it," he muttered, holding up the dagger. "This is what they were protecting."

Bog, who had been watching from a distance, raised an eyebrow. "Did you say there were rat babies in there?" he asked, his tone a mix of disbelief and disgust.

"Yeah," Eirik replied, his focus still on the dagger. "But that’s not important right now." He turned the dagger over in his hands, trying to sense if it was the source of the magic he had detected earlier. "There’s something about this," he said, his voice low. "But I can’t tell if it’s the dagger or the bag itself."

As Eirik continued his investigation, Thalrok’s attention was drawn to the strange symbols carved into the stone he had found in the bag. They were crude, almost primitive, but there was something familiar about them. He glanced around the room, his eyes scanning the walls for any sign that the symbols might match something in the tower. His gaze fell on the frozen woman suspended in the air, her body still locked in the strange magical trap that had ensnared her.

Without warning, the woman’s body suddenly dropped to the ground, the magical aura around her dissipating in an instant. She landed with a soft thud, her form crumpled but unharmed. Eirik took a cautious step forward, his hand still gripping the mysterious dagger. "Are you okay?" he asked, his voice steady but wary. "Are you conscious?"

The woman stirred, her eyes fluttering open as she pushed herself up from the ground. She glanced around the room, her gaze settling on Eirik for a moment before moving to Thalrok. "Took you long enough," she muttered, her voice laced with irritation.

Thalrok, ever the diplomat, stepped forward. "What happened to you?" he asked, his voice calm but firm.

The woman, now fully upright, brushed the dust from her clothes and looked up at the towering Goliath. "I haven’t seen one of your kind in many years," she said, her tone shifting from irritation to curiosity. "Where do you hail from? What clan is your family?"

Thalrok’s eyes narrowed. "That’s not the question I asked you," he replied, his voice cold.

The woman smirked, clearly amused by Thalrok’s response. "Fair enough," she said, her tone softening slightly. "But I think we have more pressing matters to discuss."

As the adventurers gathered around the woman, the storm outside began to die down, its fury replaced by an eerie calm. The rats were gone, the bag had been looted, and the mysterious woman was finally free. But the questions remained: What had trapped her in the first place? And what role did the strange dagger and the symbols on the stone play in the larger mystery of the tower?

The answers, it seemed, were still out there, waiting to be uncovered. And as the adventurers prepared to delve deeper into the heart of the tower, they knew that their journey was far from over.

The tension in the chamber was palpable as Nitya Gupta, the human wizard, pointed a slender finger at Bog, the satyr monk. Her voice was laced with disdain as she remarked, “I see you’ve purchased a slave in one of the great cities of Thay.” 

Bog’s eyes narrowed, his posture stiffening as he leaned against the wall, arms crossed. “I would watch your tongue,” he warned, his voice low but filled with menace. “I’m not a slave. I’m a member of this party.”

Nitya, unfazed by the satyr’s retort, didn’t even look his way. Instead, she glanced toward Eirik and Thalrok, a bemused smile curling her lips. “And you let him speak with such insolence?” she asked, her laughter light but mocking.

Thalrok, the Goliath druid, leaned in slightly and whispered conspiratorially, “We let him think he’s not a slave.” His words were accompanied by a rare smirk, though the humor was lost on Bog, who shot the druid a look that could kill.

Bog’s expression darkened, his fists clenching as he leaned further into the wall. His patience was wearing thin, but for now, he let it slide, though the murderous intent in his eyes was clear. “Have your fun,” he muttered, daring anyone to push him further.

Nitya, clearly amused by the exchange, brushed the dust off her robes and adjusted her staff. “You know so little of Thay,” she said, her voice dripping with condescension as she began to walk out of the chamber, brushing past Eirik without a second glance.

As she reached the entrance, a cloaked figure appeared, almost colliding with her. The figure paused, turning to face the group, and without a word, dropped a small stone onto the ground. The stone was smooth and dark, its surface shimmering faintly with arcane energy.

Corman, the human paladin, stepped forward, his eyes narrowing at Nitya. “Is she wearing red?” he muttered to himself before raising his voice. “Are you a spy from Thay? What are you doing here? Why shouldn’t we turn you in to the authorities?”

Nitya’s laughter rang out, sharp and cold. “And which authorities do you speak of?” she asked, her tone mocking.

Corman hesitated, realizing the absurdity of his statement. “The... the city watch,” he stammered, “the city guards.”

Nitya’s laughter only grew. “Oh, you poor fool. You know so little of Thay.”

Corman, outwitted and embarrassed, took a step back, his face flushing with frustration. He had no answer to her taunts and, for now, was done talking.

Eirik, the human fighter, ignored the exchange, his eyes fixed on the cloaked figure and the stone. “Where did this come from?” he asked, his voice stern. “Where’d you get this?”

The cloaked figure’s face was obscured by a veil of darkness, as if magic itself had swallowed their features. Their voice, shrouded in arcane distortion, responded, “This was the meeting point. The others never came.”

Eirik’s grip tightened on the hilt of his hammer, Gravebreaker. “Remove your hood,” he demanded. “Show us who you are.”

“That was not part of the arrangement,” the figure replied, their voice calm but firm.

Eirik’s patience was wearing thin. His tone grew more aggressive as he stepped forward. “Remove your hood. We mean you no harm if you mean us none. If you have this stone, perhaps we are allies.”

The figure hesitated for a moment before explaining, “I found the stone here under a day ago. I took it into my care to ensure it didn’t fall into the wrong hands.”

Nitya, growing impatient, scoffed. “I must return to Lesvath. What is the meaning of this? What is this stone? Who are you people?”

The cloaked figure turned toward her, their voice sharp. “Be silent and speak nothing of these stones if you value your life.”

Eirik nodded in agreement, casting a glance at Nitya. “He’s right. Best to stay quiet.”

Nitya, clearly uninterested in further conversation, turned on her heel and began to leave the chamber, her robes billowing behind her as she disappeared into the storm outside.

The cloaked figure turned back to the group. “I was hired to arrange transport for you and your companions back west. Have you heard from the others?”

Eirik raised an eyebrow. “Transport back to where?”

The figure’s body language shifted, a hint of frustration in their posture. “Back to your kind. Back west.”

Eirik scoffed, turning to Thalrok and Corman. “Why would we leave before the games have even begun? What of our companions?”

The figure shrugged. “The games are... quaint. I know nothing of them. I was hired for transport, but the others never showed for the rendezvous.”

Eirik’s face twisted in disbelief. “You guys deal with this one,” he muttered, before following Nitya out into the storm, leaving Corman and Thalrok to handle the cloaked figure.

Corman, growing increasingly frustrated with the cryptic conversation, stepped forward. “Speak plainly,” he demanded. “Why would our allies want to leave before the games?”

The figure responded matter-of-factly, “I was paid a great sum to transport your allies west. They never showed. I found this stone and waited, but no one came.”

Corman’s eyes narrowed. “So, the other competitors from the Lord’s Alliance chickened out?”

The figure shook their head. “No. They simply never arrived.”

Corman picked up the stone, inspecting it closely. “It’s Henk,” he muttered, his voice filled with a mix of realization and sorrow.

Thalrok placed a hand on Corman’s shoulder. “Corman, Henk’s gone. Let him go.”

The cloaked figure, sensing the rising tension, spoke again. “We should not stay idle. If you still need transport, signal me with this stone. Leave it in my care.”

Corman, emboldened by the situation, pocketed the stone. “These stones are powerful magic artifacts. You can’t even show us your face. Swear an oath to do no harm, and maybe we’ll consider handing it over.”

“I cannot show myself here,” the figure replied, their voice firm but not hostile.

Corman, feeling the weight of Thalrok’s rare approval, nodded. “So be it.”

As the two stepped outside to follow Eirik and Nitya, Corman couldn’t help but grin. “Let’s go win this thing.”

Meanwhile, Bog, ever the opportunist, had returned to the room where the rats had fallen. He gathered up the remaining canvas and created a makeshift nest for the baby rats, taking the bag and some of the cloth for himself. “Might make some dope clothes out of this,” he muttered to himself, satisfied with his haul.

The desert wind howled around them as Corman, ever the stalwart paladin, trudged through the shifting sands alongside Thalrok. His mind was heavy with concern for their missing companion, Henk, and the mysterious woman they had recently freed from the magical trap. Though the storm raged on, his thoughts were focused on the task at hand.

Breaking the silence, Corman turned to the towering Goliath at his side. “Thalrok, are you using your druid powers to track them? I don’t know much about your abilities, but I figure you could find Eirik and the woman.”

Thalrok, his face set in a grim expression, glanced down at Corman. “Which people? Eirik and the woman who was trapped?”

Corman nodded, his brow furrowed with concern.

Thalrok shook his head, his voice a low rumble. “No, I don’t have tracking powers in this form. But if we needed to find them, I could shift into a beast that might help.”

Corman, though not the sharpest tool in the shed, smiled at the answer. “That’s a great idea,” he said, feeling reassured. However, as they crested a dune, they spotted Eirik and the mysterious woman, Nitya, standing in the distance, deep in conversation. Corman’s relief was palpable, though he couldn’t shake the feeling that something strange lingered in the air.

Eirik had been walking alongside Nitya for some time, the two of them exchanging words amidst the swirling sandstorm. Eirik, ever the cautious fighter, had been probing Nitya with questions about her magic and her origins. He found her evasive, unwilling to reveal much about how she had been trapped in the tower or the nature of her powers. When he mentioned how rare it was to find outsiders in Thay, Nitya’s expression shifted, and she finally offered a piece of her past.

“I’m from Kalimport,” she said, her voice carrying through the wind. “My name is Nitya Gupta. What brings Westerners to this forsaken land?”

Eirik, ever guarded, introduced himself as Eirik Thorne of Shadowdale. He explained that they were in Thay as representatives of the Lord’s Alliance, participating in the infamous Thayan Games. But he was careful with his words, hinting that his true purpose for being in this land was more complicated. He was here to learn, to uncover secrets that Thay held close, and the games were merely an opportunity to delve deeper into the mysteries of this dangerous land.

Nitya’s interest was piqued. “I had hoped to participate in the games myself,” she admitted, “but as a foreigner, I was denied entry.”

Before Eirik could respond, Corman and Thalrok approached, their presence breaking the tension in the air. Corman, ever the straightforward one, greeted Nitya with an enthusiastic, if somewhat awkward, introduction. “Hail! We didn’t get the chance to meet earlier. I’m Corman Tress, a stronglifter from Amphail. We’re here to compete in the Thayan Games, and it seems you’ve got quite a few magic tricks up your sleeve. We’re short a spellcaster for the necromancy portion of the games—would you be interested?”

Nitya turned her gaze to Corman, her eyes narrowing as she stared at him with an unnerving intensity. The silence stretched for what felt like an eternity, and Corman shifted uncomfortably under her gaze. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Nitya broke into a small smile, a soft laugh escaping her lips. She turned to Eirik and asked, “What’s wrong with him?”

Eirik chuckled, shaking his head. “He’s a simple man, but he speaks the truth. We could use someone like you in the games.”

Nitya’s smile widened. “If it’s necromancy you need, I’ve picked up a few tricks here in Thay—the home of necromantic energies.” She reached into her bag and withdrew a small, shrunken gnoll head on a chain, holding it up for the group to see. As she cast a spell, a hyena materialized at her side, its fur bristling in the desert wind. “This is Zarok,” she said, gesturing to the beast. “One of many tricks I’ve learned.”

Corman, though clearly impressed, couldn’t shake his wariness. “How do we know we can trust you to represent the Lord’s Alliance?” he asked, his voice tinged with suspicion. “We’re here to win.”

Nitya’s eyes gleamed with amusement. “You can’t trust me,” she said bluntly. “But your options are limited. You’re short a team member, and Westerners with my talents are in short supply here.”

Thalrok, sensing the need to smooth things over, added, “You’re not the only one here who can summon beasts. But we’d welcome your help. Losing is not an option.”

Nitya’s gaze shifted to Bog, who had been silent during the exchange. “And what of your slave?” she asked, her tone casual. “Does he compete?”

Thalrok snorted. “He mostly just drinks.”

Corman, feeling the need to defend his companion, stepped forward. “Bog is no slave. He’s a mighty hand-to-hand combatant and an equal part of this group. He shines the light of the West and Lathander through this land in martial combat.”

Nitya raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised. “A free satyr in Thay? I would have expected him to be killed on sight.”

Bog, who had been listening quietly, finally spoke up. “They’ve tried,” he said with a smirk. “But they’ll have to kill me first.”

Thalrok nodded in agreement. “They’ve already tried to take Bog from us, but they’ve all failed.”

Corman, still troubled by Henk’s disappearance, took the opportunity to ask Nitya if she had seen any sign of their orcish companion. “He was lost last night,” Corman explained, “and we fear he’s been murdered.”

Nitya shook her head. “I haven’t seen an orc in some time.”

Corman frowned, pulling a small stone from his pack and dropping it dramatically into the sand at Nitya’s feet. “This was found in the same building as you,” he said. “Do you know where it could have come from? Our friend had one just like it.”

Nitya knelt down, examining the stone closely. “I don’t know for certain,” she said, “but I’ve had experience as an investigator of sorts. I could help you find your friend.”

As the wind howled around them, the group exchanged glances. Their path forward was uncertain, but with Nitya’s aid, they might just have a chance to uncover the truth behind Henk’s disappearance—and win the Thayan Games.

As the group stood in the crumbling tower, the tension between them and Nitya Gupta, the enigmatic wizard from Kalimport, was palpable. Corman, ever the earnest paladin, considered her offer to join their ranks for the upcoming necromancy challenge in the Thayan Games. His instinct was to trust her, despite her guarded demeanor and the strange circumstances of her appearance. After all, they were short a spellcaster, and her abilities could prove valuable. But before he could hand over the stone of silent passage, he hesitated, looking to Thalrok and Bog for their input.

Thalrok, the towering Goliath druid, was not so easily convinced. His hand shot out, covering the stone before Nitya could take it. He shook his head slowly, his deep voice rumbling like distant thunder. "Corman, Henk is gone. This Nitya character couldn’t even handle a few rats. We need more than that if we’re going to win these games."

Corman, always one to see the best in people, defended Nitya. "She was clearly suspended by some kind of powerful magic. The rats were likely just opportunistic scavengers. I’ve seen plenty of them back home, though never man-sized ones. But this is a strange place, with strange goings-on." He glanced at Nitya, his expression softening. "We could use her help."

Thalrok considered Corman’s words for a moment, then relented. "Fine," he said, lifting his hand from the stone. "She can have it, but only if she carries us through the necromancy challenge. We need to win."

Nitya, who had been watching the exchange with a bemused expression, simply muttered, "Thay, Thay, Thay," as if the land itself was to blame for the absurdity of the situation.

With the decision made, Corman touched his own stone to the one Nitya held, attempting to connect the arcane link between them. The stones hummed with a faint glow, their magic intertwining. As the connection formed, Bog, the satyr monk, casually picked up the bag they had looted from the rat creatures, leaving the baby rats behind in a makeshift nest of canvas. "Thay, Thay," he muttered under his breath, echoing Nitya’s earlier sentiment.

Nitya, ever practical, turned to the group. "Well, I think we’re wasting time here. Shall we continue? I’d offer you all a cup of tea at my home, but it’s barely big enough for me and one other. So, where are you staying?"

Corman, eager to engage in conversation, shared their current living arrangements with a grimace. "We’re staying in the Pit of Eternal Servitude. It’s a horrific place of torture, but apparently, it counts as barracks in this desolate and unholy land. Our plan is to head back there, take a quick break—maybe have some tea—before we get ready for the first game."

Bog, leaning against the wall with a smirk, agreed. "Yeah, I could definitely use a short rest after dealing with those desert slimes."

With their course set, the group began the short journey back to the Pit of Eternal Servitude. As they walked, Corman, ever curious, attempted to pry more information from Nitya. "Why are you here, in Thay, of all places? It seems like a living nightmare. What keeps you here?"

Nitya remained guarded, offering little more than a vague connection to her homeland. "This place reminds me of Kalimport, though smaller and drier. The people here, their ways... they’re familiar to me." Her words were cryptic, and Corman, sensing she would reveal no more, fell into contemplative silence for the rest of the walk. He had thought himself worldly, having visited Waterdeep a few times, but nothing in the West compared to the horrors he had seen in Thay.

When they arrived back at the Pit, the familiar stench of decay and suffering greeted them. As they entered, they saw three competitors from the rival Thark, Cirthae, heading out toward the Colosseum. Corman, eager to psych himself up for the upcoming strength competition, called out to them. "See you at the games!" he shouted, flexing his arms in a display of bravado.

The competitors barely acknowledged him, though one, a drow with an underdark accent, sneered and pointed at Corman and Eirik. "Thornak will break you," she said coldly, referencing their own champion for the strength competition. The drow’s words hung in the air as the group made their exit, leaving Corman to return the gesture with a pointed "I’m watching you" motion.

Eirik, always focused on the mission, approached Azkos, the unsettling bookkeeper of the Pit. "We need to register a new participant for the Lord’s Alliance delegation," he said, gesturing to Nitya.

Azkos, his appearance as creepy as ever, responded with a vague, "Anywhere you would like," before returning to his paperwork. Unfazed, Eirik led the group toward Mitek’s office, where they would officially register Nitya.

As they entered, Thalrok noticed a Thayan slave having an uncomfortable lunch with a group of devils—an odd sight, but not out of place in this hellish land. Mitek, the Thark’s overseer, greeted Eirik with a nod, though his attention quickly shifted to Nitya. "Ah, talent," he said, his eyes gleaming with recognition. "This is what brings you here."

Eirik stepped aside, allowing Nitya to approach. "I am here to represent the Lord’s Alliance," she stated confidently, her tone commanding respect.

Mitek, clearly impressed, handed her a small arcane sigil. "Speak the words, and the tally keeper will join you. His scroll is the one you will revise. Simply speak the words."

As Nitya accepted the sigil, the group exchanged glances. They had a new ally, but the road ahead was still fraught with danger. The Thayan Games loomed large, and with Henk still missing, their chances of survival—and victory—were uncertain. But with Nitya’s necromantic talents added to their ranks, they were one step closer to uncovering the mysteries of Thay and emerging victorious in the deadly competition that awaited them.

As the spectral tallykeeper materialized in the room, unfurling its ancient scroll, Nitya Gupta's eyes narrowed in curiosity. The wraith-like figure, summoned through a sophisticated illusion rune, bore no malice, but its presence was undeniably ancient and powerful. Nitya, ever the scholar, couldn't help but admire the intricate necromantic magic at play. The tallykeeper, though not physically present, was a finely tuned projection of an undead, a relic of Thay's mastery over such dark arts. With a practiced hand, she signed her name, officially joining the Lord's Alliance roster alongside Corman, Eirik, Bog, and Thalrok. As she did, she muttered under her breath, "Thay, Thay, Thay," a phrase that had become a mantra of both frustration and resignation.

Once the formalities were complete, Nitya turned to Mitek, the Red Wizard overseeing their participation in the games, and offered a polite bow. "Thank you, Red Wizard," she said, her tone respectful but guarded. She had seen enough of Thay to know that politeness could be as much a weapon as magic.

Meanwhile, Corman, ever restless and uncomfortable with the bureaucratic proceedings, had wandered off to inspect the cages nearby. His heart ached with the hope that perhaps Henk, their missing orcish companion, might be among the prisoners. Whispering a few prayers, he ran his hands along the cold iron bars, half-joking to himself about ripping them out of the ground with his bare hands. But as he peered into the pit below, his heart sank. Among the shambling undead, one figure stood out—an orc, its once vibrant skin now ashen, its eyes vacant. Corman’s breath caught in his throat as he recognized the familiar clothing. Could it be Henk?

His voice broke the silence, calling out to the rest of the group. Eirik, hearing the urgency in Corman's shout, quickly made his way to the pit. Thalrok and Nitya followed close behind. As they arrived, Nitya immediately sensed the overwhelming necromantic energy radiating from the pit. It was a locus of dark magic, a place where the dead were never truly allowed to rest. The others, however, saw only the newly risen zombies—another crop of Thay’s eternal servants. Among them was the orc that had caught Corman’s eye.

Thalrok, his expression grim, turned to Corman. "Thay, Thay, Thay," he muttered, his voice heavy with the weight of unspoken truths. "I told you, Corman. Are you willing to accept it yet?"

Corman, leaning heavily against the wooden railing, didn’t respond at first. His shoulders sagged, and for a moment, he looked utterly defeated. He had been holding onto hope, but now, faced with the possibility that his friend had become one of the undead, that hope was slipping away. Thalrok’s words echoed in his mind—was this truly Henk? Could he accept that his friend was gone?

Nitya, sensing Corman’s despair, placed a gentle hand on his shoulder. "I don’t know what your friend looked like," she said softly, "but can you really tell any of the orcs apart from this distance? Are you sure that’s him? Trust me, if he’s out there, we can find him. Don’t lose faith yet."

Corman took a deep breath and nodded, though he wasn’t entirely convinced. He squinted down at the pit, trying to discern if the orcish zombie really was Henk. The clothing was familiar, and the figure bore a striking resemblance to their missing companion, but he couldn’t be sure. Perhaps Nitya was right—perhaps there was still hope. "Yeah," he said, his voice steadier now. "Maybe you’re right. Let’s get some tea and take a short rest. We’ll need our strength for the games."

The group retreated from the pit, leaving behind the unsettling sight of the undead. Corman, still shaken, clung to a fragile sense of hope, though deep down, a part of him had already begun to accept the truth.

As they returned to their quarters, Eirik dropped off some of the goods he had looted from the ratmen earlier, stashing them in one of the storage chests. Thalrok, ever the pragmatic druid, stopped Nitya before she could settle in. "I wouldn’t sleep in this room if I were you," he warned, his tone serious.

Nitya raised an eyebrow at the Goliath’s words. "I won’t be sleeping here at all," she replied. "I have my own place—a small apartment in the more run-down part of the city."

Corman, ever the team player, disagreed. "When I’ve competed in teams before, we always stayed together to build synergy. You’re welcome to one of the fine rooms here, but if you’re going to be part of this team, you should stay with us. We need to commit to each other if we’re going to win."

Bog, ever the joker, chimed in. "Well, Henk died in that room. You’re a necromancer, right? Seems like it’d be your preferred room."

Nitya shot him a sharp look. "I am no necromancer," she corrected, though there was a hint of amusement in her voice. "That is not my school of magic."

Bog shrugged. "I don’t know much about magic. I just resist it."

Corman, ever eager to keep the group focused, quipped, "Well, you’ll have to learn some necromancy, because that’s what you’ll be doing for the team." He looked to Eirik and Thalrok for support, confident that they would agree with him. "We need to stay together and build trust if we’re going to win."

Eirik, always the voice of reason, intervened. "We can squabble over sleeping arrangements later. Right now, we need to take a short rest and prepare for the games. Everyone should focus on what they need to do—whether it’s studying, training, or stretching."

With that, Corman immediately began stretching against a nearby sword rack, his movements exaggerated and overly enthusiastic, like someone preparing for a marathon. The others couldn’t help but chuckle at his antics, but the mood remained tense. The games were fast approaching, and with Henk still missing—or worse—their chances of success seemed uncertain.

As the group settled in for a short rest, Nitya excused herself to grab a meal. She joined a group of devils who were seated nearby, though she quickly noticed that they weren’t eating the food. Instead, they sipped from small glasses that emitted faint, eerie screams. The devils conversed in a language she didn’t understand—Infernal, no doubt—but Nitya, despite her time spent in the Nine Hells, had never bothered to learn the tongue. Still, she observed them with a mixture of curiosity and caution.

The rest of the group, meanwhile, focused on their own preparations. Eirik engaged in some light training, while Thalrok meditated, drawing strength from the elemental forces around him. Bog, ever practical, took the opportunity to rest and recover his energy.

The Thayan Games loomed large on the horizon, and the group knew that the challenges ahead would test not only their strength and skill but also their unity as a team. With Nitya now officially part of their ranks, they had a chance—but only if they could learn to trust each other and work together. The storm of Thay raged on, both outside and within, and the true battle had only just begun.

The anticipation in the air was palpable as the group gathered in the dimly lit holding area beneath the Grand Arena. The roars of the crowd above echoed through the stone chambers, a constant reminder of the spectacle that awaited them. The towering colosseum loomed above, its audience a mix of humans, devils, and other strange creatures, all eagerly awaiting the next event in the infamous Thayan Games. The oppressive atmosphere of Thay, with its undead servants and Red Wizards, weighed heavily on the group, but they had little time to dwell on it. The first event was about to begin.

Nitya, ever the cautious wizard, had taken a moment earlier to cast **Comprehend Languages** as a ritual. She had overheard a group of devils nearby, their conversation hissing and guttural, discussing the quality of souls harvested from the Pit of Eternal Servitude. It seemed they were here on some sort of business trip, evaluating the souls for their infernal contracts. Nitya filed this information away, knowing well that in Thay, knowledge was power. But for now, her focus was on the upcoming games.

As the group completed their short rest, Thalrok, the Goliath druid, took a moment to recover his strength, rolling his hit dice to heal. Bog, the satyr monk, fiddled with his newly acquired bag of holding, trying to figure out how best to use it. The bag wasn’t exactly a container, but it gave him the ability to carry far more than his small frame would suggest. He muttered to himself about the mechanics of it, but in the end, he was satisfied with the extra encumbrance it granted him.

The Gamemaster’s voice cut through the chatter. “Is the group prepared to make their way to the Grand Arena?”

The group exchanged glances, each of them feeling the weight of the moment. They had been thrust into the heart of Thay’s deadliest competition, and now it was time to prove themselves. With little more than a nod, they gathered their gear and followed the winding tunnels beneath the arena, guided by undead servants and Red Wizards. The sound of the roaring crowd grew louder with each step, and soon they found themselves in a small, dimly lit chamber, waiting to be introduced to the masses.

Thalrok, ever the stoic, muttered under his breath, “Thay, Thay, Thay,” echoing the sentiment that had become a mantra for the group. The land was harsh, the people cruel, and the games deadly. But they had come too far to turn back now.

Nitya, her curiosity piqued, asked the group, “What event are we doing first? Have you decided?”

Eirik, the human fighter, was already pacing back and forth, psyching himself up for combat. “Perhaps we should do single combat first,” he suggested, his voice steady. “My strength is best used one-on-one. I’d rather face an opponent at full strength before we move on to the group defense.”

Thalrok nodded in agreement. “Let Eirik go first. He and Gravebreaker should be fresh for the single combat. We can back him up in the group defense afterward.”

Corman, the human paladin, considered the plan. He had seen what Eirik could do in battle and knew that having him at his best for the single combat would be a smart move. “I agree,” he said after a moment. “Eirik should go first.”

Bog, ever the easygoing monk, shrugged. “I’m down with whatever the group decides,” he said, his voice calm but ready for action.

With the decision made, the group was ushered forward, the magic of the arena shifting and pulsing around them. The very structure of the colosseum seemed to change, as if the arena itself was alive, responding to the will of the Red Wizards who controlled it. Nitya and Eirik, both sensitive to magic, could feel the immense power surging through the walls, as if the arena was preparing for something monumental. It reminded Eirik of the shifting temples of ancient legends, where the very ground beneath your feet could betray you.

As they approached the entrance to the arena, Eirik was separated from the rest of the group. Two undead whites, their eyes glowing with a cold, unnatural light, ushered him into a solitary chamber. The door swung open in front of him, revealing the vast expanse of the arena beyond. The crowd’s roar was deafening, and Eirik could feel the weight of thousands of eyes upon him.

Before he stepped into the arena, Corman called out to him, his voice filled with encouragement. “Henk, Henk, Henk!” he shouted, a reminder of their missing companion. It was a strange rallying cry, but in this land of the dead, it felt oddly appropriate.

Thalrok, ever the serious one, looked to Eirik and asked, “Are you ready?”

Eirik didn’t turn around. He didn’t need to. He was already in the zone, his mind focused entirely on the battle ahead. He simply nodded, his grip tightening on his hammer, Gravebreaker, as he stepped through the threshold and into the arena.

“Good,” Thalrok shouted after him. “Because you’re going!”

The door closed behind Eirik, sealing him into the arena. The rest of the group was led to the upper tier of the colosseum, where they would watch the battle unfold from a stadium-like seating area. The air was thick with anticipation, and as Eirik stepped into the center of the arena, the crowd’s roar reached a fever pitch.

The arena was vast, its sandy floor stained with the blood of countless warriors who had come before. The walls were lined with spectators, both living and dead, their faces twisted in excitement and hunger for violence. Above, devils and other infernal creatures flew through the air, their eyes gleaming with malevolent glee.

Eirik stood alone in the center of the arena, his heart pounding in his chest. He had faced many battles before, but this was different. This was Thay, a land where death was not the end, and where the games were a matter of life and undeath. He tightened his grip on Gravebreaker, his knuckles white, and waited for his opponent to appear.

The crowd fell silent, and for a moment, the only sound was the wind whipping through the arena. Then, with a deafening roar, a massive gate on the far side of the arena began to rise, revealing the shadowy figure of Eirik’s opponent.

The single combat had begun.

The tension in the arena was electric as Eirik Thorne stepped into the grand coliseum, the roar of the crowd echoing across the stone walls. High above, the Tharkeon, a formidable figure cloaked in arcane power, addressed the masses. Her voice boomed through the arena, praising the bloody history of Thay and its dominion over the weak. Today, the first single combat would be between a foreign westerner—Eirik—and the fearsome Bonebreaker himself, Corlash.

The crowd erupted into a mix of boos and cheers as the massive orc, Corlash, entered the arena, his plate armor gleaming under the harsh Thayan sun. His belt was adorned with throwing axes and potions, and in his hand, he wielded a massive greatsword. He raised his weapon high, his voice booming as he declared, "For Szass Tam! Death to the westerner!"

Eirik, unfazed by the display, dragged his hammer, Gravebreaker, across the ground, the weapon hissing against the sand. In a bold move, he taunted Corlash in Orcish, "Kradum Thrak, let's see if your strength matches your roar." The orc sneered in response, his eyes narrowing as he prepared for battle.

As the two combatants squared off, Corman, watching from the stands with the rest of the group, leaned over to Thalrok and Bog. "Do you think he’s got what it takes?" he asked, his voice filled with nervous energy.

Thalrok, ever the stoic, glanced at Corman. "We’ve already seen how orcs fare in these games," he said dryly, recalling the brutal nature of Thay’s competitions. The rest of the group echoed the sentiment with a muttered, "Thay, Thay, Thay," a mantra that had become their go-to expression for the absurdity of the land.

Eirik wasted no time, casting **False Life** on himself to bolster his defenses. As the magical energy surged through him, he sidestepped behind one of the nearby pillars, hoping to throw Corlash off balance and confuse him about his position. The orc, undeterred, roared and hurled a series of throwing axes at Eirik. The first axe missed, embedding itself harmlessly in the sand, while the second was deflected by Eirik’s shield. The third axe glanced off Eirik’s armor, and Corlash charged forward, drawing his greatsword.

Eirik laughed at the orc’s aggression, swinging Gravebreaker in a wide arc. But Corlash was ready, using his impregnable counter to twirl the hammer’s momentum and attempt to trip Eirik. The maneuver nearly succeeded, but Eirik, ever the tactician, used his **Tactical Mind** ability to maintain his balance, countering the orc’s attack.

With a swift follow-through, Eirik swung again, this time connecting with Corlash and sending the orc sprawling to the ground. The crowd erupted in cheers and jeers as the mighty Bonebreaker was toppled. Seizing the moment, Eirik activated his **Action Surge**, raising Gravebreaker high and bringing it down with all his might. The hammer missed its mark, crashing into the sand beside Corlash, but Eirik wasn’t done. He spat at the fallen orc, taunting him further.

From the stands, Corman pounded his fists against the rails, shouting encouragement. "Come on, Eirik! Let’s go!" His voice was barely audible over the roar of the crowd, but the sentiment was clear. The group watched with bated breath as the battle continued.

Corlash, undeterred by his fall, rolled to his feet and swung his greatsword in a vicious arc, catching Eirik with a backhanded strike. Blood sprayed from Eirik’s mouth, but the fighter merely grinned, wiping the blood away with the back of his hand. "Thay, Thay, Thay," he muttered, the words a challenge as much as a curse.

The crowd, sensing the intensity of the battle, began to chant along. "Thay, Thay, Thay!" they roared, their bloodlust palpable.

Eirik, ever the showman, raised Gravebreaker once more, swinging the massive weapon in an upward arc. The hammer connected with Corlash’s chin, sending the orc crashing to the ground once again. Eirik stood over his fallen opponent, arms spread wide as he addressed the crowd. "Are you not entertained?" he bellowed, his voice echoing through the arena.

Bog laughed from the stands, amused by the orc’s repeated falls. "Thay, Thay, Thay," he muttered, shaking his head.

But Corlash wasn’t finished yet. With a sneer, the orc reached into his belt and pulled out a small scroll. Before Eirik could react, Corlash activated the scroll, using **Misty Escape** to vanish from sight, teleporting 60 feet away and turning invisible. The crowd gasped in surprise, but Eirik remained focused, scanning the arena for any sign of his opponent.

Thalrok leaned over to Corman, his voice filled with dry humor. "I know you can’t triple stamp a double stamp," he quipped, referencing the orc’s repeated attempts to counter Eirik’s attacks.

Corman, still pounding the rails, shouted encouragement once more. "Come on, Eirik! You’ve got this!"

The battle wasn’t over, but Eirik had proven his strength and cunning in the face of a formidable opponent. The crowd’s chants of "Thay, Thay, Thay" echoed through the arena as the fight continued, each moment bringing the group closer to victory—or defeat.

As the dust settled and the crowd roared, one thing was clear: the Thayan Games had only just begun, and the true test of their strength and resolve was still to come.

The crowd's roar was deafening as Eirik Thorne stood in the center of the arena, blood still dripping from his hammer, **Gravebreaker**, and the lifeless body of Corlash Bonebreaker sprawled at his feet. The orc had fought fiercely, but Eirik’s skill and determination had proven too much. The battle had been brutal, and now the once-mighty orc lay in the sand, his face caved in by the final blow—a strike empowered by the booming magic Eirik had invoked in the name of **Mithdranor**. 

But the victory wasn’t without its weight. The crowd, once cheering for blood, had fallen into a stunned silence. The Thayan audience, accustomed to the brutality of the games, had expected Corlash to triumph—or at least put up a greater fight. Instead, they had witnessed a foreigner from the West defeat one of their own champions. The atmosphere shifted, and a quiet chorus of boos and murmurs began to spread through the stands. 

Eirik, unfazed by the discontent, raised Gravebreaker high, black blood still dripping from its head. "Thay, Thay, Thay!" he shouted, his voice echoing through the arena. The chant had become a rallying cry for him and his companions—a mocking reminder of the harsh land they found themselves in. His eyes scanned the crowd, daring anyone to challenge him. 

From the stands, Corman, Thalrok, and Bog watched the scene unfold. Corman, ever the enthusiastic paladin, cheered with unbridled confidence. "Thay, Thay, Thay!" he echoed, pounding his fists on the railing. He turned to Thalrok and Bog, a wide grin on his face. "Do you think he’ll let the orc yield?" he asked, though the answer was already clear.

Bog, leaning back with a smirk, shook his head. "No chance," he said, his voice filled with amusement. "Eirik’s going to kill him for sure."

Thalrok, ever the stoic druid, simply muttered, "Thay, Thay, Thay," under his breath, as if the land itself were to blame for the violence they were witnessing.

In the arena, Corlash had made one last desperate attempt to escape, vanishing with a **Misty Step** and reappearing a short distance away. But Eirik had been relentless, using his tactical mind to track the orc's every move. When Corlash tried to flee, Eirik had seized the opportunity, bringing **Gravebreaker** down once more, toppling the orc to the ground. The orc’s counterattacks had grown weaker, more frantic. His once-mighty swings were now wild and uncoordinated, his desperation palpable.

As Corlash lay on the ground, gasping for breath, Eirik stood over him, a look of disdain on his face. "Is this the might of Thay?" he taunted in Orcish, his voice dripping with contempt. "An orc who runs and hides?" He raised **Gravebreaker** again, preparing for the final blow.

From the stands, Corman called out, his voice filled with a mix of excitement and concern. "Eirik, let him yield!" he shouted. "It’s just a game!" But Eirik had no intention of showing mercy. This was Thay, and in Thay, mercy was a weakness.

With a surge of magic, Eirik invoked his **Booming Blade**, the air around him crackling with energy. He brought the hammer down with all his might, the impact sending a shockwave through the arena. Corlash’s head caved in under the force of the blow, his body twitching once before going still. The crowd gasped, the realization of what had just happened sinking in. One of their champions had fallen, and a foreigner had claimed victory.

Eirik stood over the body, his chest heaving with exertion. He placed his foot on Corlash’s chest, a final act of dominance, and ripped one of the orc’s tusks free, holding it high for the crowd to see. "Thay, Thay, Thay!" he shouted again, his voice filled with triumph.

High above, the **Tharkeon**, the overseer of the games, watched with a cold, calculating gaze. With a simple gesture, she summoned a small laurel—bronze in color, a symbol of victory in the single combat. It floated down to Eirik, who stepped forward and claimed it without hesitation. He bowed to the Tharkeon, acknowledging her authority, but his eyes were filled with defiance. He had won, and no one could take that from him.

As Eirik returned to his companions, the arena still buzzing with shock, a group of black-robed figures approached. They were the representatives of Corlash’s Thark, their faces twisted in anger and disbelief. One of them, a bald woman who was likely a Red Wizard, stepped forward, her voice dripping with venom. "This is an insult," she hissed. "We will see you in the arena again."

Eirik, ever the warrior, held up the tusk of Corlash and dragged it across his own throat in a mocking gesture. "You’ll all meet the same fate," he said coldly, his eyes locked on the Red Wizard.

Thalrok, ever the pragmatist, couldn’t resist a jab. "Looks like Eirik’s got enough hair for the three of you," he said with a smirk, referencing the bald wizards. "Soon, you’ll all be where Corlash is now."

Corman, always quick to laugh, burst out with a loud, confident guffaw. "That’s the funniest joke I’ve heard all day!" he said, slapping Thalrok on the back. The tension between the two groups was thick, but Corman’s laughter seemed to cut through it, if only for a moment.

As the black-robed figures retreated, their eyes filled with hatred, Nitya Gupta, the group’s newest member, kept her distance. She had no desire to be associated with the taunts and bravado of her companions. "Thay, Thay, Thay," she muttered to herself, shaking her head. She had lived in Thay long enough to know that such displays of arrogance could come back to haunt them.

But for now, the group had won their first victory in the Thayan Games. Eirik had proven his strength, and they had sent a clear message to their enemies: they were not to be underestimated. The road ahead would be long and dangerous, but with each victory, they grew stronger, more united.

As they left the arena, the chants of "Thay, Thay, Thay" echoed in their ears—a reminder of the land they were in, and the challenges that still awaited them.

The roar of the crowd still echoed in Eirik's ears as he and his companions were ushered into the lower tunnels beneath the arena, just moments after his victorious single combat against Corlash. The adrenaline still coursed through his veins, his breath heavy, and his mind focused as he paced back and forth, barely acknowledging the others. His companions—Corman, Thalrok, Bog, and their newest addition, Nitya—followed closely behind, preparing for the next challenge.

Corman, ever the devout paladin, couldn’t help but ask, “Eirik, which gods do you worship? Clearly, they favored you in that battle.” His voice was filled with admiration, though tinged with curiosity.

Eirik, his gaze still forward, scoffed at the notion. “I worship no gods,” he said, his voice firm. “I forge my own path and my own destiny. It’s me and Gravebreaker.” He hefted his massive hammer as if to emphasize the point, his eyes blazing with the fire of independence.

Thalrok, the Goliath druid, stepped forward and extended his arm for a warrior’s handshake. “Gravebreaker did great,” he said, gripping Eirik’s forearm tightly. “And you did alright as well.” His words were calm, but there was a glint of respect in his eyes.

Eirik accepted the gesture, but his mind was still on the fight. He barely acknowledged Thalrok’s words as he continued pacing, his body still buzzing with the thrill of combat. Bog, always the practical one, handed Eirik a beer from his stash. “Here, victory drink. This’ll calm your nerves,” he said with a grin, though he, too, was wary of what was to come next.

Suddenly, the grand horn of the arena blared, signaling the next event. The gates in front of the group groaned open, and the crowd outside erupted into cheers and boos. The Tharkeon, the overseer of the games, beckoned them forward to the center of the arena, where a massive altar made of skulls stood ominously. The vultures circling overhead cast long shadows on the sand, a grim reminder of the stakes they faced.

Bog hesitated, his instincts screaming at him not to trust the situation. “I don’t like this,” he muttered under his breath, hanging back as Eirik, still riding the high of his victory, marched forward without a second thought. The others followed, albeit more cautiously, as the Tharkeon’s voice echoed through the arena.

“Honored citizens of Thay! Behold, the second event: the legendary defense of Thaymount!” Her voice boomed, and the crowd responded with roars of approval. “In the days long past, when Thaymount, the heart of our power, was threatened by those who envied our strength, our ancestors stood defiant before the towering spires of our mountain home. They defended the very altar to Szass Tam against waves of relentless invaders. It was not only our mastery of the arcane that preserved us, but our courage, discipline, and loyalty to our supreme ruler.”

The Tharkeon’s gaze turned to the group, her eyes cold and calculating. “Now, these westerners shall face a challenge that echoes the valor of those times. Their mission: the protection of this altar. Should it crumble to dust, they forfeit this event and the black obelisk they seek. Should it stand, they will be victorious.”

The crowd’s cheers intensified, but there was an undercurrent of hostility, especially directed at Eirik. His victory over Corlash had not endeared him to the Thayan audience, and the boos were a stark reminder of how precarious their position was.

Corman, ever the tactician, took up a defensive position at the top of the ramp leading to the altar. His eyes scanned the eastern gate, ready for whatever might come. “We need to be ready,” he muttered to the others. “Let’s talk through our plan before we signal that we’re prepared.”

Eirik, still amped up, cast **Blade Ward** on himself, the magical energy wrapping around him like a protective shroud. “Anyone else need to make preparations before we start?” he asked, his voice steady despite the tension in the air.

Bog, ever the lighthearted one, downed another beer and slapped his chest. “I’m ready,” he said with a grin, though his eyes betrayed a hint of nervous energy.

Corman, ever the leader, attempted to rally the group with some motivational words, though Nitya, the human wizard, tapped her foot impatiently. “Let’s just get on with it,” she muttered, clearly eager to prove herself in the upcoming battle.

As the group signaled their readiness, the gates to the east and west of the arena groaned open. From the shadows emerged four massive great apes, their hulking forms covered in matted fur and scars from countless battles. Behind them, a colossal, King Kong-sized ape lumbered forward, its body adorned with strange devices and armor. The Tharkeon’s voice rang out once more. “Welcome the twin crimson beasts!” she declared, referring to the two massive apes leading the charge.

But that wasn’t all. As the apes began their advance, six giant trees erupted from the ground, their branches writhing like tentacles. The trees towered over the battlefield, their roots digging into the sand as they prepared to assist the apes in their assault.

The group barely had time to process the sight before the apes charged, their massive fists pounding the ground as they sprinted toward the altar. “Roll for initiative!” the Gamemaster called, and the battle began.

Eirik was the first to act, his mind racing as he assessed the battlefield. The trees were thirty feet high, and strange ropes hung from their branches. He considered delaying his turn but ultimately decided to ready himself for the onslaught.

The rest of the group sprang into action, each taking up defensive positions around the altar. Corman, ever the shield, stood firm at the top of the ramp, his sword and shield ready to fend off the attackers. Thalrok, the druid, prepared to call upon the forces of nature, while Bog, ever the agile monk, readied himself for the inevitable clash.

The apes charged, their roars echoing through the arena as the crowd chanted, “Thay, Thay, Thay!” The defense of Thaymount had begun, and the group knew that failure was not an option.

As the first wave of attackers closed in, the group braced themselves for the fight of their lives. The altar stood behind them, a symbol of their challenge and their potential victory. But the beasts before them were relentless, and the battle for the black obelisk had only just begun.

The air in the arena was thick with tension as Eirik Thorne positioned himself at the top of the staircase, his eyes scanning the battlefield. Nitya stood nearby, her focus unwavering as she prepared her next spell. The apes, massive and menacing, had begun their assault, throwing rocks and posturing in a display of primal aggression. Eirik readied himself, his muscles coiled like a spring, prepared to strike the moment one of the beasts came within range of his hammer, **Gravebreaker**.

Meanwhile, Corman knelt down in a pose reminiscent of a prayer, his fist pressed into the ground as he invoked his **Stoneborn Carapace**. The stone plates formed over his skin, giving him the appearance of a living juggernaut, much like Colossus from the tales of the X-Men. His longsword glowed with the power of **Magic Weapon**, and as he rose from his kneeling position, he did so in slow motion, the image of a warrior ready for battle.

Nitya, ever the scholar, stepped forward, her voice calm but filled with authority. "This is what many hard years of study and education can accomplish," she said, before unleashing a devastating **Fireball**. The explosion rocked the battlefield, incinerating most of the apes on the eastern side and reducing one of the towering trees to little more than ash. Only the largest of the apes survived the blast, its fury evident as it charged toward the group, bellowing in rage.

The explosion left Nitya dissatisfied. "I should have killed the large one as well," she muttered under her breath, clearly admonishing herself for what she saw as an incomplete victory.

Bog, ever the cautious monk, eyed the strange trees warily. He had initially wanted to climb them, but something about their unnatural movement gave him pause. Instead, he moved to the stairs and readied himself, preparing to strike any beast that came near. "Thay, Thay, Thay," he muttered, echoing the sentiment that had become a mantra of distrust and frustration among the group.

The apes, though shaken by the fiery explosion, began to retaliate. Rocks flew through the air, their aim poor but persistent. One of the larger apes swung itself up into the trees using a rope-like vine, revealing an unsettling connection between the creatures and the twisted flora. As if mimicking the smaller apes, the massive beast pulled a device from its pack and hurled it toward the group. But luck was on their side—the bomb flew wide, landing harmlessly in the dirt.

Thalrok, the Goliath druid, watched the chaos unfold with a calm intensity. His tattoos glowed with a soft blue light as he called upon the storm. "You missed one," he said to Nitya with a smirk, before summoning a bolt of lightning that crashed into one of the trees. The massive ape dodged the strike, swinging from branch to branch with surprising agility, but the tree itself was scorched by the druid’s raw elemental power.

Not content to remain in his humanoid form, Thalrok’s body began to shift and contort, transforming into a giant hornet. His new form buzzed menacingly beside Nitya and Bog, towering over even the largest of the apes. With a powerful beat of his wings, he ascended 40 feet into the air, surveying the battlefield from above.

Eirik, not one to be outdone, charged down the stairs, his hammer raised high. With a single, devastating swing, **Gravebreaker** connected with the ribcage of one of the apes, the sickening crunch of bone echoing through the arena as the beast crumpled to the ground. Eirik didn’t stop there—his momentum carried him forward, and with another swing, he felled a second ape. His eyes locked onto Bog as he wiped the blood from his hammer. "Get in this fight," he called, his voice filled with the adrenaline of battle.

Bog grinned, the fire in his eyes rekindled by Eirik’s challenge. He rolled his shoulders, preparing to leap into the fray, but the battlefield was far from settled. The apes, though diminished in number, were still a formidable force, and the largest among them had yet to make its move.

As the battle raged on, the group remained focused. Corman, his stone armor gleaming in the harsh sunlight, held the line at the top of the ramp, his sword ready to strike at any who dared approach the altar. Thalrok, now in his hornet form, buzzed ominously above, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Nitya, her mind racing with calculations, prepared her next spell, determined to make up for what she saw as her earlier failure. And Eirik, ever the warrior, stood ready to face whatever came next, his hammer already slick with the blood of his enemies.

The crowd roared, their voices a mix of cheers and jeers. "Thay, Thay, Thay!" they chanted, their bloodlust palpable. The defense of the altar had only just begun, and the group knew that they would need every ounce of their strength and cunning to survive the onslaught.

But they were ready. They had faced worse before, and they would face worse again. Together, they would stand strong, and together, they would conquer whatever Thay threw at them.

The arena was a cacophony of chaos and roars, both from the crowd and the beasts they faced. Eirik stood at the top of the staircase, his hammer, **Gravebreaker**, ready in his hands. His eyes scanned the battlefield, watching the massive apes as they hurled rocks and bombs toward the altar they were sworn to protect. His muscles tensed, waiting for the right moment to strike. Nearby, Nitya, the human wizard, stood poised, her focus unwavering as she prepared to unleash her next spell.

Corman, the ever-steadfast paladin, was a sight to behold. Kneeling in a prayer-like stance, he invoked his **Stoneborn Carapace**. The stone plates formed over his body, turning him into a living juggernaut. His sword, glowing with the divine power of **Magic Weapon**, gleamed under the harsh Thayan sun. Rising slowly, Corman looked every bit the warrior priest, ready to defend his companions and the altar at all costs. He raised his sword toward the sky and bellowed, “For Lathander and the Lord’s Alliance!” before charging toward one of the apes, his stone-clad form moving with surprising speed. Though the ape was too high in the trees for him to reach directly, he aimed a **Guiding Bolt** at the creature. Unfortunately, the bolt flew wide, missing its mark, and the ape taunted him with a mocking screech.

Nitya, ever the scholar, stepped forward and calmly addressed Corman, her voice carrying a hint of amusement. “Might I suggest a different technique?” With a flick of her wrist, she unleashed a **Firebolt**. The spell struck the tree the ape was perched in, causing it to disintegrate beneath the creature’s feet. The ape plummeted to the ground, landing with a heavy thud and taking significant damage. Nitya, ever the perfectionist, muttered under her breath, “I should have killed the large one as well,” clearly dissatisfied with her performance despite the success.

Bog, the satyr monk, had been hanging back, watching the battle unfold with a mixture of excitement and regret for not rushing into the fray sooner. Seeing Eirik’s bold charge into combat reignited his own fighting spirit. Slapping his chest for good luck, Bog raised his arms to the crowd, playing to their bloodlust as he sprinted forward, his fists cocked and ready. He charged at one of the apes, aiming a powerful punch directly at its face. His first strike connected, but the momentum of his follow-up attack faltered, missing its mark. Undeterred, Bog unleashed a **Flurry of Blows**, striking the ape again before disengaging and retreating back toward the altar, ready to defend it if necessary.

The apes, though battered by the group’s relentless attacks, were not done yet. One of the larger apes, clearly frustrated, hurled a bomb toward Corman. The bomb skittered across the ground, coming to rest harmlessly in the sand. Another ape attempted to slam its fists down on Eirik, but the seasoned fighter dodged the attack with ease. The ape’s attempts to bite and slam Eirik were equally ineffective, its frustration growing with each failed strike. The crowd, sensing the ape’s incompetence, began to chant mockingly, “Thay, Thay, Thay,” the mantra echoing through the arena as if to mock the very land’s failures.

Thalrok, the Goliath druid, had been watching the battlefield from his vantage point in the sky, having transformed into a massive hornet. With a powerful beat of his wings, he descended upon one of the apes, his mandibles snapping shut around the creature’s body. The ape let out a pained screech as Thalrok’s bite pierced its flesh, the druid’s insectoid form dwarfing the ape in a scene reminiscent of a kaiju battle. The crowd roared in approval, their bloodlust momentarily sated by the spectacle.

The battle continued to rage, with the group holding their ground against the onslaught of apes and the strange, living trees that had risen from the arena floor. Eirik, ever the tactician, swung **Gravebreaker** with deadly precision, felling apes left and right. Corman remained at the top of the ramp, his stone armor and glowing sword a beacon of defiance. Bog, having retreated to the altar, prepared himself for the next wave of attackers, his fists ready to strike. Nitya, her mind whirling with calculations, prepared another spell, determined to bring down the remaining apes and secure their victory.

The apes, though diminished in number, were still a formidable force. The largest among them, a towering brute covered in scars and strange devices, had yet to make its move. It lurked in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to strike. The group knew that the battle was far from over, but they were ready. Together, they had faced worse, and together, they would stand strong.

As the final ape made its move, the group braced themselves for the fight of their lives. The altar stood behind them, a symbol of their challenge and their potential victory. The crowd’s chants of “Thay, Thay, Thay” echoed in their ears, a reminder of the land’s cruelty and the stakes they faced. But they were determined. They would defend the altar, defeat the apes, and claim their place in the Thayan Games.

The battle for the black obelisk had only just begun, but they were ready.

The battle in the arena raged on, the air thick with tension and the echoes of the crowd’s chant: “Thay, Thay, Thay.” Eirik Thorne, ever the warrior, stood firm at the top of the staircase, his hammer, **Gravebreaker**, ready for another strike. The apes, massive and fierce, were relentless in their assault, but Eirik and his companions had no intention of letting the altar fall.

Thalrok, in his massive hornet form, buzzed ominously above the battlefield. His transformation had been a strategic move, giving him a vantage point from which to unleash his devastating lightning strikes. With a flick of his wings, he summoned another bolt from the storm cloud above, the crackling energy tearing through the air and obliterating one of the smaller apes that had been harassing Eirik. The lightning also clipped one of the larger apes, sending it reeling back in pain. Thalrok, now fully in his element, made eye contact with the stands, his gaze locking onto Miranda, the Thayan overseer who had been watching the battle unfold with steely indifference. “Look what you’ve done,” Thalrok bellowed, his voice filled with defiance. “You’re next.”

Eirik, invigorated by the storm’s power, swung **Gravebreaker** with deadly precision at the giant ape in front of him. The hammer connected with a sickening crunch, sending the beast sprawling to the ground. Without hesitation, Eirik aimed another swing at the ape’s jaw, but the creature, desperate to survive, managed to pull itself away, using the vine-like ropes hanging from the trees to hoist itself back up. The ape’s agility, aided by its **Arboreal Tactician** ability, allowed it to evade Eirik’s strike and ascend 30 feet into the air, leaving Eirik frustrated but undeterred. “Thay, Thay, Thay,” he muttered under his breath, the mantra now a reflection of his mounting irritation.

Meanwhile, Corman, always the stalwart paladin, surveyed the battlefield. His eyes darted between the ape and the massive hornet that was Thalrok. Without a second thought, Corman leaped onto Thalrok’s back, gripping the druid’s thorax as he attempted to mount the ballista that Henk had once wielded. The memory of their lost companion flashed through Corman’s mind, and for a moment, he felt a pang of sorrow. But there was no time for grief—only action. Fumbling with the ballista like a caveman trying to operate a foreign device, Corman struck it repeatedly in an attempt to make it work. “Come on, come on,” he muttered, his frustration evident.

Thalrok, though in his hornet form, managed to maintain his composure. “Thay, Thay, Thay,” he buzzed, a hint of humor in his voice as he felt Corman’s weight on his back. The paladin’s stone armor made him heavier than usual, but Thalrok was more than capable of carrying the load. However, the situation was precarious. If Thalrok were to take a hit or ascend too quickly, Corman could easily lose his grip and fall. The Gamemaster, ever mindful of the mechanics at play, reminded them that an **Animal Handling** check would be required if Thalrok made any sudden movements while carrying Corman and the ballista.

As the battle continued, Corman used his **Lay on Hands** ability to heal Thalrok, restoring 20 points of health and ensuring that the druid could continue fighting at full strength. “Well done, Thalrok,” Corman said, patting the druid on the side. Thalrok, though unable to speak in his wasp form, gave a subtle nod of appreciation.

Nitya, the human wizard, had been watching the chaos unfold with a keen eye. Raising her oaken staff, she unleashed another **Firebolt** at the tree that housed the giant ape. The spell struck true, nearly reducing the tree to ash and causing the ape to teeter dangerously on the edge. The beast clung to the branches for dear life, barely managing to hold on. “Thay, Thay, Thay,” Nitya muttered, her frustration with the ape’s resilience evident.

Bog, the satyr monk, had been biding his time, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Seeing the ape in his face, he sprang into action, delivering a series of powerful blows. His fists connected with the ape’s skull, sending it crashing to the ground in a bloody heap. “Thay, Thay, Thay,” Bog muttered, wiping the blood from his knuckles as the ape’s lifeless body slumped next to Eirik on the stairs.

But the battle was far from over. Another ape, seeing its comrade fall, charged toward Thalrok, its jaws snapping as it attempted to bite the druid. The Gamemaster confirmed that the ape could indeed grapple the massive hornet, despite the size difference. Nitya, ever the strategist, used her **Portent Die** to influence the outcome of the grapple, ensuring that Thalrok would not be ensnared by the ape’s powerful grip. The ape’s attempt to grapple Thalrok failed, and the druid remained free to continue his assault from the skies.

As the battle raged on, the group knew that they were in for a long fight. The apes were relentless, and the living trees that dotted the battlefield added an unpredictable element to the fray. But they were determined. Together, they had faced worse, and together, they would stand strong.

The crowd’s chants of “Thay, Thay, Thay” echoed through the arena, a constant reminder of the land’s cruelty and the stakes they faced. But the group was ready. With Eirik’s strength, Thalrok’s elemental power, Nitya’s arcane mastery, Corman’s divine protection, and Bog’s unrelenting fists, they would defend the altar and claim their place in the Thayan Games.

The battle for the black obelisk had only just begun, but they were prepared for whatever Thay threw at them next.

The battle in the arena was reaching its fever pitch, with chaos erupting around the altar. The massive apes, driven by some fiendish influence, relentlessly hammered away at the sacred structure, their blows echoing through the air. Eirik Thorne, the human fighter, stood at the top of the staircase, his hammer **Gravebreaker** ready for another strike. His eyes locked onto the ape that had just cartwheeled and backflipped down from the trees in a display of surprising agility, landing near Nitya and the altar. But despite its acrobatic prowess, the creature seemed unable to land a single blow on the altar, its fists flailing ineffectively.

"Thay, Thay, Thay," Eirik muttered under his breath, the mantra now a reflection of the absurdity of their situation. He watched as the ape continued to attack the altar, but its strikes were wild and unfocused, as though it were struggling to maintain control over its own body. Beside him, Thalrok, in his hornet form, hovered above, ready to strike again.

Thalrok, sensing the urgency of the situation, ascended 30 feet into the air, his wings buzzing loudly. He called down another bolt of lightning from the storm cloud he had conjured earlier, aiming it directly at the ape attacking the altar. The bolt struck with a deafening crack, and the ape let out a bloodcurdling scream as the electricity coursed through its body. Its ears rang from the impact, but it remained standing, its fiendish determination driving it forward.

Eirik, seeing an opening, charged forward, his hammer raised high. He swung **Gravebreaker** with all his might, the weapon connecting with the ape's knee in a devastating blow. The creature's leg buckled under the force, its ACL torn apart by the sheer power of Eirik's strike. The ape wobbled on one leg, its balance faltering, but it somehow managed to remain upright. Eirik, undeterred, swung again, this time aiming for the other leg. His second strike missed, the momentum carrying him off balance, but he quickly recovered, using his **Great Weapon Master** ability to regain control and deliver a final, crushing blow. The ape's legs gave out entirely, and it crumpled to the ground, its body twitching as it fought to stay conscious.

Meanwhile, Corman, perched atop Thalrok's hornet form, struggled to operate the ballista mounted on the druid's back. The device, designed for use in the Blood War, was intuitive enough for magical use, but Corman's unfamiliarity with it made the process awkward. He fumbled with the controls, trying to get a clear shot at the remaining apes. Finally, he managed to fire a couple of bolts, the laser-like projectiles zipping through the air and striking one of the apes squarely in the chest. The creature staggered, but it wasn't enough to bring it down.

"Hold on, Corman!" Thalrok buzzed, his voice muffled by his insectoid form. He swooped down in a diving attack, his mandibles snapping at the ape below. The creature, already weakened by the lightning strike, let out a pained howl as Thalrok's bite tore into its flesh.

Nitya, standing near the altar, watched the chaos unfold with a calculating gaze. She raised her staff, a bolt of fire shooting from its tip and striking the ape that had been relentlessly attacking the altar. The fire seared the creature's fur, but it remained focused on its task, its fists slamming into the stone structure with reckless abandon.

Bog, seeing the ape's determination, decided to take matters into his own hands. With a mighty leap, the satyr monk vaulted over the altar, landing gracefully on the other side. He unleashed a flurry of blows, his fists connecting with the ape's body in rapid succession. The creature, already weakened by the group's relentless assault, finally succumbed to its injuries, its massive form collapsing onto the altar in a pool of blood.

Bog, ever the showman, dipped his finger into the blood and smeared it across his face in a primal display of victory. "Thay, Thay, Thay," he muttered, his voice low and filled with satisfaction. He then moved to the other side of the altar, ready to face whatever came next.

But the battle was far from over. Another ape, seeing its comrades fall, used its **Standing Leap** ability to bound across the battlefield, landing next to the altar with a thundering crash. It raised its fists high, letting out a terrifying roar as it attempted to intimidate the group. The sheer force of its display sent a wave of fear through the arena, and for a moment, even the most seasoned fighters felt a pang of doubt.

Eirik, shaken by the ape's roar, felt his grip on **Gravebreaker** falter. His heart raced, and for the first time in the battle, he hesitated. "Thay, Thay, Thay," he muttered, trying to steady himself. He knew the fear was irrational, but the creature's fiendish presence was overwhelming.

Corman, however, remained unfazed. Drawing on his divine strength, he shook off the fear and prepared to strike again. "Lathander's light will guide us," he said, his voice filled with conviction. He readied the ballista for another shot, determined to bring down the final ape.

As the ape continued its assault on the altar, the group knew they had to act quickly. The altar was cracking under the strain, and if it fell, they would lose the challenge. But they were not done yet. Together, they had faced worse, and together, they would stand strong.

The crowd's chants of "Thay, Thay, Thay" echoed through the arena, a constant reminder of the land's cruelty and the stakes they faced. But the group was determined. With Eirik's strength, Thalrok's elemental power, Nitya's arcane mastery, Corman's divine protection, and Bog's unrelenting fists, they would defend the altar and claim their place in the Thayan Games.

The battle for the black obelisk was nearing its climax, but they were ready for whatever Thay threw at them next.

The air was thick with tension as the battlefield fell momentarily silent, the last of the massive apes crumbling to the ground in a heap of fur and blood. The group, battered but still standing, took a collective breath. Eirik Thorne, his hammer **Gravebreaker** still slick with the blood of his foes, stood like a statue, his muscles tense as he shook off the lingering effects of the ape’s terrifying roar. His eyes locked onto the altar they had sworn to protect, now cracked but still standing. 

Thalrok, still in his massive hornet form, hovered above the battlefield, his wings buzzing as he surveyed the scene. The storm he had conjured crackled ominously in the sky, the occasional bolt of lightning arcing down to the earth. Below, Corman, perched precariously on Thalrok’s back, fumbled with the ballista, his mind momentarily drifting to thoughts of pizza as he absentmindedly aimed the weapon. He fired a couple of bolts, but his shots went wide, missing the mark. “Thay, Thay, Thay,” he muttered, frustrated with his aim but determined to keep trying.

Nitya Gupta, ever the pragmatic wizard, raised her staff and unleashed a **Firebolt**, her spell striking true and reducing one of the last remaining apes to a smoldering heap. The creature let out a final, pitiful screech before collapsing in a cloud of ash and smoke. The crowd, watching from the stands, erupted into a mix of cheers and jeers, their bloodlust momentarily sated by the spectacle. But Nitya wasn’t satisfied. She strode forward, her eyes scanning the battlefield for any tools or bombs the apes might have left behind. She knelt beside one of the massive corpses, patting it down in search of anything useful. “Thay, Thay, Thay,” she muttered under her breath, echoing the sentiment that had become a mantra of frustration and determination among the group.

As the dust settled and the battlefield grew quiet, the group exchanged glances. They had survived the first wave, but they knew the fight was far from over. The altar still stood, but it was only a matter of time before the next wave of attackers arrived. They had mere moments to prepare.

Corman, still perched on Thalrok’s back, waved his hand in a distracted manner, as though speaking to a dog. “There, land there on the west side,” he said, his voice absentminded as he gestured toward the top of the west stairs. Thalrok, ever patient, complied, hovering 15 feet above the ground as Corman readied the ballista, aiming it toward the western gate in preparation for the next wave. “Thay, Thay, Thay,” Corman muttered, his focus finally returning to the task at hand.

The group barely had time to catch their breath before the ominous tones of the **Tharkeon** rang out once more, her voice echoing through the arena like the tolling of a death knell. “Once the foul legions of the Crimson had been slain, slithering masses, boiling herds of foul scavengers, beasts from across Thay, slithered into daylight.” Her words sent a chill down the spines of the group as they braced themselves for what was to come.

At once, the gates at each of the three entrances to the arena hissed open, and a menagerie of twisted beasts began to pour into the battlefield. From the south, a giant pangolin, its scales gleaming in the harsh sunlight, sneered at the group, its body coiling as it prepared to roll into a ball and charge. To the west, a twisted mass of ooze, dripping with rotting weapons, armor, and gear, slithered forward, its gelatinous form oozing across the sand. And from the east, a grotesque undead corpse, its body steaming and hissing with plumes of smoke and fire, staggered into view, accompanied by a massive parrot-like creature, its feathers matted with blood and filth.

The group exchanged glances, their faces grim but resolute. They had survived the first wave, but the second wave promised to be even more dangerous. The beasts that now approached were filled with a bloodlust that rivaled the apes they had just defeated, and they had no intention of letting the altar stand.

“Thay, Thay, Thay,” Eirik muttered, his grip tightening on **Gravebreaker** as he prepared for the next onslaught. He could feel the weight of the battle pressing down on him, but he refused to back down. His eyes flicked to the others, each of them readying themselves for the fight ahead.

Thalrok, still in his hornet form, buzzed ominously above, his wings casting long shadows over the battlefield. He could feel the storm above him, ready to unleash its fury once more. “Don’t be afraid,” he called down to the others, his voice calm but commanding. “We’ve faced worse.”

Nitya, her staff glowing with arcane energy, nodded in agreement. “Fire the ballista,” she instructed Corman, her voice steady. She knew they had little time before the beasts reached the altar, and every second counted.

Corman, still fumbling with the ballista, cursed under his breath as he tried to line up a shot. “Thay, Thay, Thay,” he muttered, his frustration mounting. But he refused to give up. With a determined grunt, he fired the ballista, the bolt zipping through the air toward the oncoming horde.

As the beasts closed in, the group steeled themselves for the fight of their lives. They had survived the first wave, but the second wave promised to be even more brutal. The altar stood behind them, a symbol of their challenge and their potential victory. But the beasts before them were relentless, and the battle for the black obelisk was far from over.

As the group rolled for initiative, the crowd’s chants of “Thay, Thay, Thay” echoed through the arena, a constant reminder of the land’s cruelty and the stakes they faced. But they were ready. With Eirik’s strength, Thalrok’s elemental power, Nitya’s arcane mastery, Corman’s divine protection, and Bog’s unrelenting fists, they would defend the altar and claim their place in the Thayan Games.

The second wave had begun, and the group knew that the true test of their strength and resolve was still to come.
