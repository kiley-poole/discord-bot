The sun had barely risen over the city of Lesvath when the adventurers awoke to grim news. Their companion, Henk Blackspear, had been taken in the dead of night by a succubus, a member of a rival faction. The Thayan Inquisition, known as the Probity Corps, had attempted to wipe the memories of the group, but Thalrok, the Goliath druid, had resisted the enchantment. He alone remembered the events of the night, while the others were left with a vague sense of unease.

The previous day had been no less troubling. A cryptic encounter at the Nameless Tavern still weighed heavily on Bog, the satyr monk, while Eirik, the human fighter, couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched. The streets of Lesvath had become more dangerous, more hostile. The group had been marked, and they knew it.

Now, as the first day of the Thayan Games dawned, the adventurers—Corman, Nitya, Thalrok, Eirik, and Bog—set out from the Pit of Eternal Servitude, their temporary barracks, to follow a signal from one of their message stones. The stone, a relic from Waterdeep, had pulsed with a message, guiding them westward through the mage district and toward the outskirts of the city.

The streets of the mage district were bustling with activity, filled with humans and the occasional undead servant. As they left the district, the stark contrast between the wealth of the mages and the squalor of the outer city became apparent. The once grand cityscape gave way to crumbling buildings and downtrodden peasants. The adventurers moved quickly, their pace brisk as they scanned the alleys and streets for signs of danger.

Eirik, ever vigilant, kept his eyes peeled for any sign of the Darakul or the bird-like creatures that had been following them. Corman, on the other hand, was convinced that Henk was still alive, perhaps returning from a drunken bender. His optimism, though misplaced, was a small comfort in the face of the grim reality they found themselves in.

As they approached the western gate, the number of undead diminished, replaced by human guards and laborers. The air grew thick with sand as a minor storm began to swirl around them, the wind carrying a faint sparkle as if the desert itself were enchanted. Thalrok, no stranger to the wilderness, noted the strange quality of the sand, but said nothing. The group pressed on, their destination in sight: a weathered stone tower perched atop a rocky cliff.

The sense of being watched had not left them. It was a constant, oppressive feeling, as if unseen eyes were always upon them. The Probity Corps, the secret police of Thay, were known to monitor potential threats, and the adventurers were no exception. Despite this, they pressed forward, determined to reach the source of the signal.

As they crested a hill, a figure emerged from the swirling sand—a man leading a large camel, followed by several half-clothed human slaves. The slaves, barefoot and weary, trudged through the sand with their heads bowed, their spirits broken.

Corman's eyes narrowed. "We've got to do something," he muttered to Thalrok. "No one deserves to live like this."

Thalrok frowned but said nothing. It was Bog who spoke next, his voice calm but firm. "I agree with you, but this is a small pebble in a large pond. Stopping this man will do nothing in the grand scheme. We can help more people if we focus on the competition."

Eirik, always pragmatic, waved his hand dismissively. "We don't have time for this."

But Corman was not so easily swayed. "There's always time to do what's right," he said, stepping in front of the man and his camel. He raised his hand, trying to catch the wanderer's attention. "Hey! Stop!"

The man, however, paid him no mind. He continued to trudge forward, his slaves following in silent resignation. It was clear they had been on a long journey, their bodies and spirits alike worn down by the harsh desert.

Bog stepped forward, placing a hand on Corman's shoulder. "We can't save everyone," he said quietly. "Not like this."

Corman clenched his fists, frustration evident on his face. But he knew Bog was right. Stopping this one man would not change the fate of the countless slaves in Thay. Their mission was larger than this, and time was not on their side.

Reluctantly, Corman stepped aside, allowing the man and his slaves to pass. The group watched in silence as they disappeared into the swirling sand, their forms swallowed by the storm.

"We need to keep moving," Eirik said, his voice cutting through the tension. "The signal is close."

With a final glance at the disappearing figures, the adventurers turned their attention back to the task at hand. The stone tower loomed ahead, and whatever awaited them there would no doubt be another test of their resolve.

The winds howled through the desert as the group trudged onward, the oppressive heat and swirling sandstorm making every step feel like a battle. The slaves had long since disappeared into the storm, and Corman’s heart still weighed heavy with frustration. He had tried to buy their freedom, offering the Thayan wanderer nine gold pieces, but the man had dismissed him with a wave. The slaves, too, seemed beyond help, moving mechanically as if under some unseen compulsion. One had even collapsed in the sand, only to scramble back to his feet and rejoin the others as if driven by some invisible force.

Bog had been right. There was something unnatural about the slaves, something that couldn’t be solved by a simple act of charity. “I don’t think we could free these slaves if we wanted to,” Bog had said, his voice calm but resolute. “It seems like they’re under some kind of spell. Maybe the group we met at the tavern can help us break them free later.”

Corman had slumped in defeat, his shoulders sagging as he watched the slaves disappear into the sandstorm. His sense of justice burned within him, but for now, he had no choice but to let them go. The signal from their message stone was still guiding them, and they couldn’t afford any more delays.

As they pressed on, the sands beneath Eirik began to shift. What had been solid ground moments ago suddenly gave way, and he found himself sinking. The sand swirled around him, forming a vortex that pulled him down as if a creature beneath the surface had latched onto him. “What the—!” Eirik shouted, struggling to free himself.

Without hesitation, Bog darted forward, his hooves kicking up sand as he closed the distance. The satyr was quick, his fists flying as he struck at the swirling mass of sand. His blows landed with surprising effect, the strange consistency of the sand shifting under his punches like wet clay. “It’s like punching sludge,” Bog muttered, but he could tell he was doing damage. He struck again, this time channeling his ki to stun the creature.

The swirling mass froze in place, its form shattering slightly under the force of his blow. But as it stilled, two more swirls of sand began to form nearby, as if the creature had multiplied. “Great,” Bog grumbled, “now there’s more of them.”

Corman, still coughing from the dust and heat, charged forward, his mind racing. He had never fought in conditions like this—this desert might as well have been a magical storm to him. His thoughts drifted to the peaceful sunshine of his home village as he pushed through the sand, his armor slowing him down. “Unhand him!” he shouted, throwing a javelin with all his might at the nearest swirling mass. The javelin struck true, embedding itself into the creature, though it seemed to have little effect on the shifting sands.

Eirik, still partially trapped, swung his massive hammer, Gravebreaker, at the frozen sand. The blow landed with a satisfying crunch, pieces of the creature flying off as the weapon connected. But even as he struck, he knew they couldn’t afford to stay here. “We need to keep moving!” he called out to the others. “This might just be the beginning. We need to get to the tower!”

Thalrok, ever the calm presence in the storm, nodded in agreement. “This dust is getting worse,” the Goliath druid said, his voice barely audible over the howling wind. “We need to find the signal.”

With a swift motion, Thalrok called upon his druidic magic, using his Cloud Jaunt to teleport closer to the creatures. The sand beasts, still stunned, couldn’t react in time as Thalrok swung his staff at the nearest one, his blow landing with a solid thud. The creature recoiled, but it was clear that more would come if they didn’t move quickly.

Eirik, seeing an opening, took a few cautious steps forward, his eyes fixed on what he believed to be the entrance to the tower. The swirling sands seemed to be concentrated here, as if guarding the path ahead. “We need to break through,” he muttered, gripping Gravebreaker tightly as he prepared for the next wave of attacks.

As the adventurers fought, the sands around them continued to shift and swirl, the storm growing ever more intense. The creatures they faced were unlike anything they had encountered before—formless, shifting, and seemingly endless. But they fought on, their resolve unshaken. The tower loomed ahead, its weathered stone walls barely visible through the storm. Whatever awaited them inside, it was clear they would need every ounce of strength and cunning to survive.

With each passing moment, the sands seemed to press in closer, the storm intensifying as if the desert itself were alive and determined to swallow them whole. But the group pressed on, united in their goal. Their path was fraught with danger, but they would not be deterred. The signal was close, and with it, perhaps, the answers they sought.

The desert winds howled, whipping the sand into a frenzy as the group continued their battle against the strange, shifting creatures. Bog, the satyr monk, had been locked in a fierce struggle with one of the sand beasts, his fists landing solid blows that seemed to momentarily freeze the swirling mass. His strikes were precise, each one shattering the creature slightly, causing it to lose cohesion and melt back into the desert storm. Yet, despite his success, the battle was far from over.

Bog could feel the ground shifting beneath him, the sand behaving like quicksand as it pulled him down. He attempted to leap away, but the moment he tried to disengage, the sand seemed to come alive, enveloping him. It was as if the desert itself sought to claim him, pulling him deeper into its suffocating grasp. He struggled, his hooves slipping in the loose sand, but it was no use—he was trapped, both restrained and knocked prone.

“Dammit!” Bog cursed under his breath, feeling the weight of the sand pressing down on him. His body ached from the strain, and the abrasive texture of the sand felt like it was tearing at his skin. Despite his predicament, he wasn’t done yet. With a surge of determination, he summoned his inner ki, using the energy to fuel a final flurry of blows. His fists moved in a blur, striking out at the sand creature even from his prone position. Though the attacks were less effective due to his disadvantage, he landed enough hits to weaken the creature further, its form destabilizing.

Nearby, Corman, the human paladin, was struggling as well. Huffing and puffing through the oppressive heat, he tried to heed Eirik’s advice and move toward the tower. However, the difficult terrain of the shifting sands slowed his progress. He could feel the weight of his armor dragging him down, each step becoming more laborious than the last. His mind raced, torn between the urge to help his companions and the need to press forward toward their goal. He pushed himself as far as he could, but exhaustion—or perhaps fear of the monstrous creatures—forced him to pause just shy of the nearest sand beast.

As Corman hesitated, one of the sand creatures surged forward, its movements mimicking the flow of water as it attempted to envelop Thalrok, the goliath druid. The creature’s amorphous form shifted and swirled around Thalrok’s legs, trying to pull him down into the sand as it had done to Bog. But Thalrok was quick on his feet, stepping out of the creature’s grasp just in time. The druid’s calm, steady presence remained unshaken, even as the storm raged around him.

Eirik, the human fighter, was a whirlwind of action. Seeing Bog being swallowed by the sand and another creature closing in on Thalrok, he spun on his heel, abandoning his retreat toward the tower. With a mighty swing, he brought his warhammer, Gravebreaker, crashing into the ground beside him. The impact sent a shockwave through the sand, striking the creature with a force that caused it to recoil. Eirik’s muscles strained as he swung again, his weapon biting into the creature’s form like a pickaxe digging into clay. The sand beast shuddered under the assault, but it wasn’t finished yet.

“I’ve had enough of this!” Eirik growled, summoning all his strength for two more powerful strikes. Gravebreaker connected with a satisfying crunch, the sand creature beginning to lose its shape. Though it was still clinging to life, Eirik could sense it was on the verge of collapse.

Thalrok, inspired by Eirik’s relentless assault, decided to follow suit. He raised his sickle and swung at the creature nearest him, the blade cutting into the swirling sand. The creature reacted, shifting away from the blow, but Thalrok’s strike had done its job—it had weakened the beast, buying the group precious time.

Meanwhile, Bog continued to struggle against the sand that held him captive. He could feel the creatures gnawing at him, their abrasive forms like rough sandpaper grinding against his skin. Panic flickered at the edges of his mind as he realized he was sinking deeper, the sand threatening to swallow him whole. He tried to pull himself free, but the sand’s grip was too strong. Despite his best efforts, he remained trapped, his body sinking further into the churning mass.

From his prone position, Bog still had the presence of mind to fight back. He summoned what little strength he had left, preparing to strike again. But the effort was draining, and he knew he couldn’t keep this up much longer. His companions were fighting valiantly, but the sands were relentless, and the storm showed no signs of abating.

The battle raged on, each member of the party locked in their own struggle against the desert’s monstrous denizens. The creatures seemed endless, their forms shifting and reforming as they attacked again and again. Yet, despite the odds, the adventurers fought with everything they had. The tower loomed in the distance, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos, but it felt as if it were miles away.

As the storm intensified, the group knew they had to finish this fight quickly or risk being overwhelmed. The sands were alive, and they would not rest until the adventurers were buried beneath them.

The storm howled as the adventurers struggled against the relentless sand creatures. Bog, the satyr monk, was in a dire situation. Trapped by the swirling sands, he flailed wildly, punching at the mass of sand that seemed intent on pulling him under. His voice was hoarse from shouting, “Let me go! Let me go!” His fists flew in desperation, but it felt like punching water—each hit barely scattering the sand before it reformed around him. The more he struggled, the deeper he sank.

Corman, the human paladin, saw his friend’s plight and acted without hesitation. “Bog, get down! Lathander will save you!” he shouted, sprinting forward. As he ran, he muttered a prayer to his god, calling upon divine power to aid him. With a mighty swing of his longsword, he channeled a divine smite into the sand creature gripping Bog. Holy light erupted from his blade, tearing through the sand. The radiant energy seemed to disrupt the creature, causing it to falter in its hold on the satyr. 

Corman wasn’t done. He called on his Channel Divinity, sending a surge of divine energy into Bog, granting him temporary strength and resilience. Bog felt the warmth of Lathander’s blessing wash over him, bolstering his spirit. The paladin swung again, but this time, his blade glanced off the creature, the flat of his sword striking the sand harmlessly. Corman cursed under his breath—he was used to practice fights, not the chaos of real combat.

Meanwhile, Thalrok, the Goliath druid, found himself in a similar predicament. The sand creature near him moved with a primal hunger, attempting to wrap itself around his legs and pull him down. Thalrok managed to dodge the initial grasp, but the creature was relentless, and soon he was chest-deep in the churning sand. “Eirik! Finish it!” Thalrok shouted, his voice booming over the storm.

Eirik, the human fighter, was a whirlwind of action. His warhammer, Gravebreaker, swung with brutal precision, smashing into the sand creatures with enough force to shatter their cohesion. One by one, the creatures melted away under his blows, their forms dissolving back into the desert. As the last creature near Thalrok disintegrated, the druid found himself free, no longer restrained by the sand.

Wasting no time, Eirik charged toward Bog, who was still struggling against the creature enveloping him. With a mighty swing, Gravebreaker connected with the sand, and the creature crumbled under the impact. The storm seemed to calm for a moment as the last of the sand creatures was defeated. The group stood there, panting and covered in dust, but victorious. 

“We must hurry out of this storm,” Eirik said, his voice urgent. He began moving toward the tower in the distance, not waiting for the others to catch their breath. Bog, still shaken, stood up and brushed the sand off his legs. “It’s like all the hair’s gone from my legs,” he muttered, trying to lighten the mood despite his ordeal.

Corman approached him, placing a hand on his shoulder. “Did you hear the voice of Lathander when you were blessed by his holy energy?” the paladin asked, his tone earnest. Bog gave him a sidelong glance, unsure how to respond, but there was no time for further conversation. The storm was still raging, and they needed to move.

As the group made their way toward the tower, they noticed that the storm seemed to lessen in intensity as they approached. The dust was no longer as thick, and visibility improved. However, as they neared the entrance, they caught sight of small, rat-like humanoids skittering away at their approach. These creatures, no more than two or three feet tall, carried rudimentary weapons and wore scraps of cloth and leather. They watched the adventurers warily, their movements quick and defensive, much like frightened animals.

Eirik squinted, trying to get a better look at the creatures. “Are they wearing clothes? Do they resemble anyone we’ve seen before?” he asked. The creatures moved too quickly for him to get a clear view, but they seemed intelligent, if not particularly hostile.

Thalrok attempted communication. “We mean you no harm,” he called out, his voice deep and resonant. “We just want to know what’s going on here.” But the rat creatures only scurried further away, clearly not interested in conversation. They disappeared into a small room nearby, leaving the adventurers alone in the entrance.

Eirik approached the door to the tower, inspecting it closely. It appeared to be a simple wooden door, but something about it felt off. His experience in crypts and dungeons had taught him to recognize the subtle hum of arcane magic, and he could feel it here, faint but present on the other side of the door. He jiggled the handle—it wasn’t locked, recently used perhaps, but he could sense magic beyond.

Thalrok, seeing the hesitation in Eirik’s eyes, made a decision. “Let’s just do it,” he said, counting down from three. Corman stood beside him, ready to assist in breaching the door.

At the count of three, Eirik pushed the door open and stepped inside, Gravebreaker at the ready. What they saw inside was both strange and unsettling. Suspended in mid-air, frozen in a hunched pose, was a middle-aged woman. Her features were Thayan, or perhaps of another darker-skinned ethnicity, but she was completely paralyzed, hovering several feet off the ground. Even the sand particles around her were frozen in place, trapped in a strange, glowing purple light.

The group exchanged wary glances. Whatever had happened here, it was far from ordinary. The tower held secrets, and this woman was at the center of them. But what kind of magic had done this, and why? They would need to proceed carefully—this was only the beginning of the mysteries they would face.

The air inside the tower was thick with tension as Eirik stepped closer to the woman suspended in the glowing purple light. His eyes narrowed, trying to discern the nature of the magic that held her in place. He reached out with his senses, attempting to understand the trap that had ensnared her. It was a familiar feeling—he had encountered similar arcane mechanisms before, though none quite like this. After a moment, it became clear. This was no ordinary spell; it was a magical trap, likely triggered by some kind of ward or rune. Whoever had set it had done so with precision, and the woman had been caught in its snare.

"She's not a threat," Eirik said, his voice low. "Whatever did this to her happened a long time ago. We're safe, but I can't tell how to free her."

Thalrok, the goliath druid, stepped closer, his brow furrowed as he examined the woman. Her robes were frozen in place, as if time itself had stopped around her. Even as he tugged gently at the fabric, it remained stiff and unmoving. "She's completely paralyzed," Thalrok muttered. "This isn't just a spell on her body—it's affecting everything she's wearing."

Bog, ever practical, glanced around the room. "Do you see anything that looks like the signal stone? Maybe it's connected to her somehow."

Eirik shook his head. "No, nothing. But I think we should check those rat creatures we saw earlier. They might know something."

Bog smirked, crossing his arms. "Thalrok, you can talk to rats, right? Maybe they'll tell us what’s going on."

The group moved cautiously toward the small room where the rat-like creatures had retreated. As Thalrok peered inside, he saw them—seven small, hunched figures, each clutching crude weapons. They had taken up defensive positions around a large, swollen bag. Their beady eyes glinted with fear, but they were ready to fight if necessary.

Corman, still in the main room, was busy turning over stones and bricks, muttering to himself as he searched for some hidden lever or switch that might deactivate the magical trap. He paid little attention to the others as they confronted the rat creatures.

Thalrok, feeling the weight of the group's expectations, took a deep breath and attempted to communicate with the rats. His voice took on a strange, chittering quality as he tried to mimic their language. Several of the creatures perked up, their ears twitching, but they didn’t respond. Instead, they tightened their grip on their weapons and huddled closer around the bag.

Bog, ever the joker, quipped, "Anyone got any cheese? Maybe that'll get them talking. They’re not touching my beer, though."

Eirik, standing in the doorway, took a closer look at the scene. The rats were clearly guarding the bag, but why? He could sense a faint magical aura emanating from it, though he couldn’t tell if it was connected to the trap that held the woman. "There's magic in that bag," Eirik muttered. "But I can't tell if it's related to the trap."

Thalrok, growing impatient, decided to try a different tactic. He straightened to his full height, towering over the rats, and let out a booming growl. "Give us the bag, or face the consequences!" His voice echoed through the small room, and two of the rats immediately bolted, scurrying past Eirik and Thalrok and disappearing into the sandstorm outside. 

Bog chuckled, half-jokingly sticking out his foot as if to trip one of them, but he let them go. "Too easy," he muttered.

The remaining rats, however, were not so easily cowed. They pressed closer together, their small bodies trembling, but their eyes were filled with a desperate determination. They held their tiny daggers out, hands shaking, but they were ready to defend the bag with their lives.

Eirik, ever the diplomat, decided to take a different approach. He pulled out a piece of leather armor he had taken from their missing companion, Henk. "Thalrok, tell them we’ll trade this for the bag," he said, holding up the armor.

Thalrok translated the offer, his voice softer this time. One of the rats cautiously stepped forward, eyeing the armor with interest. After a moment of hesitation, it took the leather armor and stuffed it into the bag. The exchange seemed to be going smoothly—until Thalrok reached for the bag.

The moment his large hands touched it, the remaining rats lunged at the group, their tiny weapons flashing in the dim light. "They’re not giving it up without a fight!" Thalrok shouted, readying himself for combat.

The room erupted into chaos as the rats swarmed, their small knives glinting as they darted in and out of the adventurers' reach. Eirik and Thalrok, having anticipated the attack, were quick to react, drawing their weapons and preparing for battle.

Bog, always light on his feet, danced around the rats, his hooves kicking up dust as he dodged their attacks. "I knew this would happen," he muttered, a grin spreading across his face. "Let’s make this quick!"

The adventurers were outnumbered, but not outmatched. As the rats lunged at them with their crude weapons, the group fought back with precision and skill. Eirik swung his warhammer, Gravebreaker, with deadly accuracy, smashing one of the rats into the ground. Thalrok, using his druidic magic, summoned a gust of wind to knock several of the creatures off balance, sending them sprawling.

Corman, hearing the commotion, finally abandoned his search for a hidden lever and charged into the fray, his longsword gleaming as he cut down another rat. "I knew you’d get into trouble without me!" he shouted, his voice filled with righteous fervor.

Despite their small size, the rats were fierce, and they fought with the desperation of creatures who had nothing left to lose. But the adventurers were relentless, and one by one, the rats fell.

As the last rat collapsed to the ground, clutching its tiny dagger in a final act of defiance, the room grew still. The bag, now unguarded, lay at Thalrok’s feet. The adventurers exchanged weary glances, their breathing heavy from the battle.

"Let’s see what they were protecting," Eirik said, wiping the sweat from his brow.

Thalrok reached down and carefully opened the bag. Inside, they found a small, glowing stone—the source of the magical aura Eirik had sensed earlier. It wasn’t the signal stone they had been searching for, but it was clearly important.

"What is it?" Bog asked, peering over Thalrok’s shoulder.

"I’m not sure," Thalrok replied, his voice filled with curiosity. "But whatever it is, it’s powerful."

The group stood in silence for a moment, contemplating their next move. The woman was still frozen in the other room, and now they had this mysterious stone. Their path was far from clear, but one thing was certain: their journey was only just beginning.

The battle within the crumbling tower raged on as Eirik, Bog, Thalrok, and Corman faced off against the scurrying rat-like creatures. The air was thick with tension, and the smell of singed fur lingered from Thalrok’s earlier lightning strike. Eirik, gripping his warhammer Gravebreaker tightly, took a deep breath and surveyed the chaotic scene before him. The rats, though small, were quick and cunning, darting between the adventurers’ legs and attacking with crude, makeshift weapons.

Eirik’s eyes locked onto one of the rats, and with a grim determination, he swung Gravebreaker in a powerful arc. His first strike missed, smashing into a nearby bag, sending its contents scattering across the floor. The rats shrieked in panic, their tiny voices hissing in anger as they swarmed around the bag, desperate to protect it. Unperturbed, Eirik swung again, this time connecting with one of the creatures. The force of the blow sent the rat crumpling to the ground with a loud, pitiful squeak. The others hissed in response, their small bodies trembling with fury.

As the rats regrouped, one of them darted through the legs of Thalrok, the goliath druid, moving with an unnatural speed. Thalrok, momentarily caught off guard, reached for his weapon but was too slow to react. The rat slipped past him, its tiny dagger gleaming in the dim light as it lunged at Bog, the satyr monk. The blade nicked Bog’s calf, eliciting a low growl from him.

“You little bastard,” Bog muttered, his eyes narrowing as he glared down at the creature. He raised his fist, ready to strike, but before he could react, Thalrok summoned a storm cloud overhead, calling forth a bolt of lightning. The storm crackled to life, and with a roar, Thalrok unleashed the lightning upon the rats. The bolt shot down through the broken roof of the tower, striking the ground with a deafening crack. One of the rats was instantly vaporized, its body reduced to little more than a charred husk. The others screeched in terror, their fur singed and smoking from the blast.

Bog, seizing the opportunity, lunged at the rat that had attacked him. His hands moved with practiced precision, and before the creature could react, Bog had it in a chokehold. The rat struggled, its tiny limbs flailing as it tried to escape, but Bog’s grip was unrelenting. “You’re coming with me,” he growled, dragging the creature toward a nearby well. Without hesitation, he dangled the rat over the edge, its squeaks turning to panicked wails as it realized its fate.

With a smirk, Bog released his grip, and the rat plummeted into the darkness below. A sickening crunch echoed up from the depths of the well, and Bog dusted off his hands, satisfied with his work. “That’s one less problem to deal with,” he said, stepping back toward the group.

Meanwhile, Corman, the human paladin, had been searching the tower for any clues or traps, but the sound of battle drew his attention. Hearing the crack of lightning and the squeals of the rats, he kicked open a door and emerged into the fray. Spotting a rat near the well, Corman’s eyes narrowed. With a practiced motion, he hurled his final javelin. The weapon flew through the air, pinning the rat to the side of the well with a sickening thud. The creature let out one last squeak before falling limp, its body dangling lifelessly from the javelin.

Corman grinned, a sense of pride swelling within him. “Still got it,” he muttered to himself, recalling the friendly javelin-throwing competitions of his youth. Bog, ever the showman, gave Corman a small golf clap, nodding in approval. “Not bad,” he said with a smirk.

The remaining rats, seeing their comrades fall one by one, began to panic. One of them, eyes wide with fear, bolted for the exit, disappearing into the swirling desert sands outside. Another, desperate and cornered, lunged at Eirik with its tiny dagger. Eirik snarled, bringing Gravebreaker down with all his might. But the rat was quick, dodging the blow as the hammer slammed into the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust. Furious, Eirik swung again, this time catching the rat with the edge of the hammer. The creature squealed in pain, its tiny body crumpling under the force of the blow.

Thalrok, seeing the rat’s pitiful state, prepared to finish it off, but the creature, driven by sheer terror, scrambled to its feet and fled into the desert, following the path of its companion. The adventurers stood in the now-silent tower, catching their breath as the dust settled around them.

“That was... more than I expected,” Thalrok muttered, glancing around at the scattered bodies of the rats.

Eirik wiped the sweat from his brow, his grip on Gravebreaker relaxing. “They were small, but they fought like cornered animals,” he said, his voice tinged with frustration. “We should check that bag. Whatever they were guarding, it might be important.”

Thalrok nodded, kneeling down to inspect the bag that the rats had been so fiercely protecting. Inside, he found a small, glowing stone, its surface pulsing with a faint, ethereal light. It wasn’t the signal stone they had been searching for, but it was clearly magical in nature.

“What do you think it is?” Bog asked, peering over Thalrok’s shoulder.

“I’m not sure,” Thalrok replied, his brow furrowed in thought. “But whatever it is, it’s powerful.”

Corman, still riding the high of his javelin throw, stepped forward. “We should take it with us,” he said. “It might be useful later.”

The group agreed, pocketing the stone as they prepared to move deeper into the tower. The storm outside still raged, but within the tower, a strange calm had settled. The woman they had seen earlier, frozen in time by some unknown magic, remained suspended in the other room, her fate still a mystery.

As they regrouped, the adventurers knew that their journey was far from over. The tower held many secrets, and the desert outside was unforgiving. But together, they would face whatever challenges lay ahead.

With the rats defeated and the strange stone in hand, the group pressed on, determined to uncover the mysteries of the tower and find the answers they sought.

The storm outside continued to rage, its winds howling through the cracks in the ancient tower, carrying the scent of charred sand and ozone from Thalrok's earlier lightning strikes. Inside, the battle against the rat-like creatures had come to a swift and brutal end. Thalrok, the Goliath druid, stood tall, his hand still raised to the sky as he called down another bolt of lightning. The crackling energy tore through the air, striking a rat dead center, its small body thrown against the crumbling stone walls of the watchtower in a smoking heap.

Bog, the satyr monk, had been having a bit of fun with the fight, his drunken technique making him nimble yet unpredictable. He had charged at one of the rats, horns lowered like a sprinter at the starting line, but the creature nimbly dodged his attack, climbing over him with surprising agility. Bog, ever the improviser, swung his fist around in a wide arc as he fell backward, catching the rat mid-crawl. The sickening snap of its neck echoed through the tower, and Bog lifted the limp creature by its arm, muttering in frustration, "Ah, damn it."

With the last of the rats dispatched, the group took a moment to catch their breath. The storm outside showed no signs of abating, the air thick with the smell of burning sand. Thalrok, still maintaining his connection to the storm above, decided to let it continue for now, its presence giving the desert an eerie, charcoal-tinged atmosphere.

Eirik, the human fighter, turned his attention to the bag the rats had been guarding so fiercely. He knelt down and began rummaging through its contents, his brow furrowing as he pulled out a variety of strange items. "There’s a lot of stuff in here," he muttered, more to himself than to the others. He listed off the contents: canvases, cloves, ginger, odd pieces of leather armor, and various rat-men trinkets. But what caught his attention most was a mysterious dagger and a carved stone covered in crude symbols.

As he examined the stone, Eirik felt a faint magical resonance, not from the stone itself but from the air around it. It wasn’t the source of the magic that had trapped the woman in the other room, but it seemed important nonetheless. "This might be part of some tradition," Eirik mused, turning the stone over in his hands, "or maybe it matches something else in this tower."

He stood and walked back into the room where the woman had been suspended in the strange purple light. As he approached, the magic that had held her suddenly dissipated, and the woman dropped to the ground with a soft thud. Eirik took a cautious step forward, his hand resting on the hilt of his weapon. "Are you okay? Can you hear me?" he asked, his voice steady but wary.

The woman stood, brushing the dust from her robes with an air of irritation. "Took you long enough," she said, her voice sharp and condescending.

Thalrok approached, his massive frame towering over her. "What happened to you?" he asked, his voice calm but demanding answers.

The woman, who introduced herself as Nitya, looked up at Thalrok with a bemused expression. "I haven’t seen one of your kind in many years. What clan do you hail from?" she asked, ignoring his question entirely.

Thalrok’s eyes narrowed. "That’s not the question I asked you," he replied, his voice cold.

Nitya’s gaze shifted to Bog, her eyes narrowing as she took in his satyr form. "I see you’ve purchased a slave from one of the great cities of Thay," she said with a sneer.

Bog, leaning casually against the wall, straightened up, his eyes flashing with anger. "Watch your tongue," he growled. "I’m no slave. I’m a member of this party."

Nitya, clearly amused, let out a soft laugh. "And you let him speak with such insolence?" she asked, turning back to Thalrok and Eirik. Thalrok, ever the pragmatist, leaned in and whispered, "We let him think he’s not a slave."

Bog shot him a murderous glare, but Thalrok’s deadpan delivery and Nitya’s laughter only seemed to heighten the tension in the room. Bog crossed his arms, leaning back against the wall with a look that promised retribution later.

As Nitya began to make her way toward the exit, brushing past Eirik and Thalrok, she was met by a hooded figure standing at the entrance of the chamber. The figure, cloaked and obscured by some form of illusion magic, dropped a small stone onto the ground—a Stone of Silent Passage, used for clandestine meetings. The figure’s face was completely hidden, a veil of darkness concealing any identifiable features.

Corman, the human paladin, stepped forward, blocking Nitya’s path. His eyes narrowed as he took in her red robes, a symbol often associated with Thay. "You’re a spy, aren’t you?" he accused, his voice filled with righteous conviction. "What are you doing here? Why shouldn’t we turn you over to the authorities?"

Nitya laughed, a sound that grated on Corman’s nerves. "And which authorities would those be?" she asked mockingly. Corman faltered, realizing that the city’s authorities were the very Thayan wizards he despised. "The city watch... the guards," he stammered, but Nitya’s laughter only grew louder.

"You know so little of Thay," she said, her voice dripping with condescension. "So very little."

Defeated, Corman stepped aside, his face flushed with embarrassment. Eirik, ignoring the exchange, focused on the hooded figure. "Where did this stone come from?" he asked, his voice low and commanding. "Who are you?"

The figure’s voice, heavily distorted by magic, responded, "This was the meeting point. The others never came." The words were cryptic, but Eirik wasn’t satisfied. "Remove your hood," he demanded. "Show us who you are."

The figure shook its head. "That was not part of the arrangement."

The tension in the room was palpable as the mysterious figure stood before them, its identity hidden, its motives unclear. The adventurers exchanged glances, uncertain of what to do next. The storm outside raged on, but within the tower, the real storm was just beginning.



As the storm raged outside, Eirik stood firm, his hand gripping the hilt of Gravebreaker as he faced the hooded figure. His voice, now edged with frustration, cut through the howling winds. “Remove your hood,” he demanded, his tone leaving no room for negotiation. “We mean you no harm if you mean us none. If you have this stone, perhaps we are friends.”

The figure hesitated, its body language uncertain, before responding in a low, distorted voice, “I came across the stone while waiting for the rendezvous. It was found here just under a day ago. I took it into my safekeeping to ensure it didn’t fall into the wrong hands.”

Nitya, who had been standing nearby, grew impatient. Her eyes narrowed as she regarded both the hooded figure and the adventurers. “I must get back to Lesvath,” she snapped, her voice sharp with irritation. “What is the meaning of this? What is this stone? And who are you people?”

The hooded figure’s voice turned cold as it addressed her, “Be silent. Speak nothing of these stones if you value your life.” The warning was clear, and though directed at Nitya, it sent a chill through the group.

Eirik, sensing the tension, nodded slightly in agreement with the hooded figure’s caution. Nitya, however, had no interest in staying. With an air of indifference, she turned and began to walk toward the storm outside, wanting no part of the mysterious exchange.

The hooded figure, undeterred by her departure, continued, “I was here to arrange transport. Have you heard from the others?”

Eirik’s brow furrowed in confusion. “Transport? Back to where?”

The figure’s body language shifted, shoulders slumping slightly as if in defeat. “Back west. To your kind.”

Eirik scoffed, his frustration bubbling over. “Why would we leave before the games have even begun? What of our companions that we arrived with?”

The hooded figure’s response was dismissive. “The games? I know nothing of them. My people were hired for transport, but the rendezvous was missed. We were supposed to take you and your allies westward, but they never showed.”

Eirik’s patience ran thin. He turned to Thalrok and Corman, his voice clipped. “You two deal with this. I’m going after the woman.” Without waiting for a response, he stormed out into the swirling sands, determined to catch up with Nitya.

Corman, growing tired of the cryptic conversation, stepped forward, his voice booming with authority. “Speak plainly!” he demanded. Thalrok, ever the pragmatist, added, “Why would we need transport west before the games? What’s really going on here?”

The hooded figure replied matter-of-factly, “This was the purpose for which we were paid—a great sum by your allies. We were to transport you westward, but the others never arrived.”

Corman’s eyes narrowed as he processed the information. “So, you’re saying the other competitors from the Lord’s Alliance chickened out?”

The figure shook its head. “No. The transport never happened. I was supposed to meet them today, but they never made contact. I found this stone in an attempt to locate them, but it was the only one. I may have accidentally triggered it.”

Corman approached the stone, his mind racing. He picked it up, turning it over in his hand. “It’s Henk,” he muttered, his voice laced with a mix of realization and sorrow.

From the edge of the room, Eirik’s voice cut through the air, “Corman, he’s dead. Let him go.”

The hooded figure, sensing the growing tension, spoke again. “We should not stay idle. Please, give me the stone. If you require transport, you can signal me with it.”

Corman wasn’t convinced. He felt the weight of the stone in his hand and the power it represented. His eyes locked onto the hooded figure. “These stones are powerful artifacts, and you won’t even show us your face. Reveal your true identity and swear an oath to do no harm to us, and maybe then we’ll consider giving you the Stone of Silent Passage.”

The figure’s response was immediate, but evasive. “I cannot show myself here.”

Corman, feeling emboldened, pocketed the stone. “So be it,” he said, his voice firm. A rare nod of approval from Thalrok followed, a gesture Corman had never received before. The paladin’s chest swelled with pride as he turned to Thalrok. “Let’s go win this thing.”

As they made their way outside, the hooded figure stood in stunned silence, watching them depart. Meanwhile, Bog, ever the opportunist, had been busy making a nest out of the canvas he’d found in the rats’ bag, preparing for the next leg of their journey with his usual carefree attitude.

As Corman and Thalrok trudged through the storm, Corman turned to the druid. “Are you using your druid powers to track them?”

Thalrok raised an eyebrow. “Which people?”

“Eirik and the woman who was trapped,” Corman clarified.

Thalrok chuckled softly. “I don’t have tracking powers in this form, but if we needed to find them, I could shift into a beast that could.”

Corman nodded, satisfied with the answer, though unsure of what kind of beast Thalrok had in mind. It wouldn’t matter, though. As they crested a dune, they spotted Eirik and Nitya on the horizon, their forms silhouetted against the swirling sands.

Eirik had caught up to Nitya, and though the storm muffled their conversation, it was clear they had been speaking for some time. Eirik had asked her about her magic and how she’d been trapped in the tower, but Nitya had been evasive, offering little in the way of answers. She had, however, revealed her name—Nitya Gupta, from Kalimport.

When Eirik introduced himself as Eirik Thorne of Shadowdale, Nitya’s interest had piqued. She had been intrigued by the Thayan Games, lamenting that she had not been allowed to participate due to her status as a foreigner. Eirik, sensing a potential ally, had explained their role as representatives of the Lord’s Alliance, though he remained coy about his true intentions in Thay.

As Corman and Thalrok approached, the storm seemed to ease slightly, the winds dying down just enough for them to hear the tail end of the conversation. Nitya glanced over her shoulder at the approaching adventurers, her expression unreadable. Whatever secrets she held, it was clear she wasn’t ready to reveal them just yet.

The storm may have subsided for now, but the mysteries surrounding the Thayan Games—and the enigmatic Nitya—were only just beginning.

As the swirling sands of Thay’s desert began to settle, Eirik Thorne stood with a twinkle in his eye, his gaze fixed on Nitya Gupta. The sharp-eyed wizard had proven herself resourceful, wielding magic with ease, and Eirik saw an opportunity. "Perhaps, Nitya Gupta," he began, his voice smooth, "you’re in luck. If you tell us more about what you bring to these games, we might consider letting you join us. We find ourselves down a companion as of this morning."

Nitya, without hesitation, reached into her robes and withdrew a shrunken gnoll head hanging from a chain. With a flick of her wrist, she cast a quickened spell, summoning a hyena that materialized beside her. "This is Zarok," she said, her voice steady, "one of many tricks I’ve picked up." The hyena’s eyes gleamed with a feral intelligence as it padded forward, its presence a testament to Nitya’s control over the necromantic arts.

As Corman and Thalrok approached, Corman could see that the conversation between Eirik and Nitya was going well. Though not the brightest man, Corman had a certain intuition for such things. "Hail!" he called out, his voice booming with the confidence of a man who had lifted many a heavy stone in his day. "We didn’t get the chance to meet earlier. I’m Corman Tress, a stronglifter from the village of Amphale. We’re each here to participate in our own way in the Thayan Games. It appears you have many magic tricks, and as Eirik may have mentioned, we need a spellcaster for the Necromantic Magic Off. Would you be interested?"

Nitya stared at Corman, unblinking, her eyes boring into his with an intensity that made him shift uncomfortably. The silence stretched on for what felt like an eternity, and just as it became unbearable, a small smile tugged at the corner of her lips. She turned to Eirik, her voice laced with amusement. “What’s wrong with him?”

Eirik chuckled, his tone light. "He’s but a simple man, though he speaks the truth. As I said, we could use someone with your talents in the games."

Nitya’s smile faded as she considered the offer. "If it’s necromancy you need," she mused, "I’ve picked up a few tricks here in Thay—home of necromantic energies."

Corman, having heard insults about his intelligence many times before, fell silent. His shoulders slumped slightly, but he didn’t argue. He had grown used to such comments over the years, and though they stung, he knew when to hold his tongue. Sensing his discomfort, Zarok, the hyena, padded over to Corman and rubbed up against him. Corman, unfamiliar with hyenas but recognizing the gesture from his experience with dogs, reached down and patted the creature’s head, though his hand trembled slightly with uncertainty.

Nitya observed the interaction with a bemused expression. "Ah, simple creatures drawn to each other. He likes you, Corman. That’s a good omen."

Corman, still petting Zarok, looked up at her, his voice more serious now. "How do we know we can trust you to represent the Lord’s Alliance? We’re here to win."

Nitya’s response was blunt. "You can’t trust me. But it sounds like your options are limited. You’re short a team member, and westerners are in short supply here in Thay—especially westerners with my talents." She gestured to her hyena, her staff, and the various magical trinkets that adorned her robes.

Thalrok, standing nearby, folded his arms and raised an eyebrow. "You’re not the only one who can summon beasts," he said, his tone calm but firm. "However, we’d welcome your help. Losing isn’t an option for us."

Nitya’s gaze shifted to Bog, the satyr monk, her eyes narrowing. "And what of your slave? Does he compete as well?"

Thalrok smirked. "He mostly just drinks."

Before Bog could respond with one of his usual quips, Corman stepped forward, his voice filled with pride. "Bog’s no slave. He’s a mighty hand-to-hand combatant, and he’s proven his worth time and again. He’s a free being, an equal part of this group, and he shines the light of the West and Lathander through this land in martial combat."

Nitya seemed taken aback by this revelation. She had expected a satyr in Thay to be little more than a slave or a curiosity, but the sincerity in Corman’s words made her pause. "A free satyr in Thay?" she muttered, more to herself than anyone else. "I would have expected him to be killed."

Bog, ever the opportunist, grinned. "They seem to avoid me. Outside of the occasional quip about bartering for my body after I die, they’ll have to kill me first."

Thalrok nodded in agreement. "They’ve tried to take him from us before. They’ve all failed."

Corman, his thoughts turning to their missing companion, asked, "Have you seen an orc named Henk? He was with us, but we lost him last night. Some of us fear he’s been murdered."

Nitya shook her head. "I haven’t seen an orc in some time."

Corman, his face clouded with concern, pulled out the Stone of Silent Passage and dropped it into the sand at her feet. "This was found in the same building as you. Do you know where it came from?"

Nitya knelt down, inspecting the stone. "I don’t know," she admitted. "But I’ve had experience tracking others. Perhaps I could help you find your missing friend."

Corman, ever earnest, thought it was a good idea, but before he could agree, Thalrok stepped forward, placing his hand over the stone. "Corman, Henk’s gone. This Nitya couldn’t even handle a few rats."

Corman, always the optimist, defended her. "She was clearly trapped by some kind of magic. The rats were likely just opportunistic."

Thalrok considered his words for a moment before lifting his hand. "Fine. She can have the stone, but she must carry us through the necromancy challenge."

Corman, satisfied, touched his own stone to the Stone of Silent Passage, attempting to connect the arcane link before handing it over.

With the matter settled, Nitya stood, brushing the sand from her robes. "We’re wasting time here. Shall we continue? I’d offer you tea at my home, but it’s too small for all of us. Where are you staying?"

Corman grimaced. "We’re staying in the Pit of Eternal Servitude. It’s as horrific as it sounds, but we’re heading back there to rest before the first game."

Bog, ever practical, nodded. "A rest sounds good after those desert slimes."

The group made their way back to the mage district, the oppressive heat of the day settling in. As they walked, Corman, ever curious, struck up a conversation with Nitya, trying to understand why a Westerner like her would choose to stay in a place as grim as Thay. Nitya’s answers were vague, but Corman couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more to her story than she was letting on.

As they approached the Pit of Eternal Servitude, the group steeled themselves for the challenges ahead. The first game was fast approaching, and with Nitya now on their side, they hoped to turn the tide in their favor. But in a land as treacherous as Thay, trust was a rare commodity, and alliances could shift as easily as the desert sands.

The oppressive heat of Thay’s desert had given way to the familiar stench of the Pit of Eternal Servitude as the adventurers returned to their grim quarters. The journey back from the tower had been largely silent, with Corman lost in thought after Nitya’s brief mention of her hometown, Kalimport. Though she had said little, her words lingered in Corman’s mind. He had thought himself worldly, having visited Waterdeep several times, but the sheer cruelty and desolation of Thay was unlike anything he had ever experienced. The idea that Kalimport could be anything like this hellish place was beyond his comprehension. As they walked, he fell into quiet contemplation, his usual bravado subdued.

Arriving at the Pit, they found themselves amidst the other participants of the Thayan Games. Three competitors from the host Thark, Sirthay, were making their way out, likely heading to the Coliseum. Corman, eager to psych himself up for the upcoming strength competition, couldn’t resist a taunt. “See you at the games!” he called out, flexing his arms in a boastful display. Thalrok, ever the stoic druid, followed Corman’s lead. “We’ll see you on the court,” he added, his voice carrying a weight of certainty. 

Bog, leaning casually against the door, stared down the competitors as they passed, his eyes cold and calculating. Eirik, however, was indifferent, his mind focused on the task at hand. He had no time for posturing—there were more pressing matters to attend to.

As the Sirthay competitors passed, the drow among them shot a venomous glare at Corman and Eirik. “Tharnak will break you,” she hissed, pointing at the two men. It was clear that Tharnak, their champion, would be a formidable opponent in both the strength competition and single combat. Corman, undeterred, responded with a mocking gesture, pointing two fingers at his eyes and then back at the drow as if to say, *I’m watching you.*

With the tension in the air thick, Eirik turned his attention to the task of registering Nitya as a participant for the Lord’s Alliance. He approached Ascos, the eerie and unsettling bookkeeper, and asked where they might register their new companion. Ascos, his voice dripping with an unsettling calm, replied, “Anywhere you would like.” Eirik scoffed at the cryptic response and made his way to Mitek’s office, determined to get things done properly.

As they entered the office, Medasek, the Red Wizard overseeing the registrations, greeted them with an air of disinterest. Eirik wasted no time, asking if there had been any updates on the Darakul attack or if the Thark responsible had been found. Medasek, still shuffling through papers, replied dismissively, “No, nothing found. Business as usual.” However, his demeanor shifted when he noticed Nitya standing behind Eirik. “Ah, talent,” he remarked, his tone suddenly more intrigued. “This is what brings you here.”

Eirik stepped aside, allowing Nitya to approach. She introduced herself with a calm confidence. “Wizard, I am here to represent the Lord’s Alliance,” she said, her voice steady. Medasek, clearly more interested in Nitya now that he recognized her as a fellow practitioner of magic, explained the registration process. He handed her a small arcane sigil, instructing her to speak the words and summon the tally keeper. Nitya did as instructed, and almost immediately, a spectral wraith appeared, unfurling a scroll before her. The spidery runes on the scroll shifted into common language, and a signature block appeared, awaiting her name.

As Nitya signed her name, she studied the wraith closely, her mind racing with questions. She could tell that the wraith was not truly present in this location but was instead a projection, summoned through an ancient and sophisticated illusion rune. It was a finely-tuned undead entity, likely thousands of years old, and though it bore no ill will, its presence was a stark reminder of the necromantic power that permeated Thay. Impressed by the craftsmanship of the illusion, Nitya finished signing her name and bowed slightly to Medasek. “Thank you, Red Wizard,” she said, her tone respectful but guarded.

Meanwhile, Corman had wandered off, uninterested in yet another bureaucratic meeting. He found himself near the cages that lined the pit, whispering quiet prayers for the unfortunate souls trapped within. His mind wandered to thoughts of his missing companion, Henk. As he ran his hands along the bars, he couldn’t help but wonder if Henk might be among the prisoners. A grim thought crossed his mind—what if Henk had been turned into one of the undead servants?

Almost as if in answer to his unspoken question, Corman’s gaze drifted toward the pit. There, among the shuffling zombies, was a figure with distinctly orcish features. His heart sank. “Henk?” he called out, his voice barely more than a whisper. The zombie, like the others, continued its aimless shuffling, oblivious to the world around it.

Eirik, hearing Corman’s voice, rushed to his side, followed closely by Thalrok and Nitya. As they arrived, they too saw the orcish zombie among the newly risen servants. Thalrok gave Corman a knowing look, one that said, *I told you so.* “Are you willing to accept it yet?” he asked, his voice soft but firm.

Corman stood there, leaning against the railing, his heart heavy with grief. He didn’t respond, but the look on his face said it all. He was finally coming to terms with the fact that Henk was gone.

Sensing his despair, Nitya placed a hand on Corman’s shoulder. “I don’t know what your friend looked like,” she said gently, “but can you really tell any of the orcs apart? Are you sure that’s him? Trust me, if he’s out there, we can find him. Don’t lose faith yet.”

Corman didn’t respond, but her words offered a small glimmer of hope. Whether Henk was truly gone or not, the group would have to press on. The Thayan Games were fast approaching, and now, with Nitya officially part of their team, they would need to focus on the challenges ahead.

The Pit of Eternal Servitude may have been a place of despair, but the adventurers were not yet ready to give in to hopelessness. The games awaited, and with them, the possibility of redemption—or ruin.

As the group settled back into the oppressive confines of the Pit of Eternal Servitude, Corman found himself staring at the shuffling orcish figure among the newly risen undead. His heart sank as he gazed at the creature, its features disturbingly similar to those of his missing companion, Henk. The paladin’s mind raced with doubt, and though he couldn’t be sure if this was truly Henk, the mere possibility filled him with a deep sense of dread. He leaned heavily against the railing, his knuckles white as he gripped the cold metal. 

Nitya, ever perceptive, approached him, her voice soft but steady. “You can’t be certain, can you? It could be any orc. Don’t lose hope yet.” Her words were measured, but they carried an unexpected weight that seemed to pull Corman back from the brink of despair. He nodded at her, partially convinced, though a part of him clung to the delusion that Henk might still be alive. “Yeah, you’re right,” Corman muttered, his voice barely audible. “Maybe we should get some tea, take a short rest. I’ve seen enough of this place.”

He turned away from the pit, eager to distance himself from the sight of the undead orc, whether it was Henk or not. The others followed suit, each retreating to their quarters to prepare for the Thayan Games. Eirik, ever practical, went to one of the rooms and began unloading some of the odd trinkets and goods he had collected from the rat-like creatures earlier. Thalrok, the goliath druid, paused before Nitya as she made her way toward the exit. “I wouldn’t sleep here if I were you,” he warned, his deep voice carrying an ominous edge.

Nitya, unfazed, glanced at him and replied, “I won’t be. I have my own apartment in the run-down part of the city.” Her tone was matter-of-fact, as if she had no intention of staying in the dilapidated pit any longer than necessary. 

Corman, overhearing the exchange, frowned. “When I’ve traveled with my teams for competitions, we always stayed together to build synergy. We’re going to need that if we’re going to win. You’re welcome to one of the fine rooms here,” he said, his voice laced with irony, “but I think you need to stay with us. Commit to the team.”

Bog, ever the joker, chimed in with a smirk. “Well, Henk died in one of these rooms. You’re a necromancer, right? That’s probably your preferred room.” His tone was playful, but the words carried a certain sting.

Nitya corrected him with a sharp glance. “I am no necromancer. That is not my school of magic.” Her gaze softened slightly as she forgave his ignorance. “You’re a satyr, after all. I don’t expect you to know the intricacies of magic.”

Bog shrugged, unbothered. “I don’t know magic. I just resist it.” His casual demeanor was a stark contrast to the tension in the room.

Corman, not one to let the conversation drop, quipped, “Well, you’re going to have to learn. That’s what you’re doing for the team.” He looked to Eirik and Thalrok for support, confident that they would back him up. “To really be a team, she needs to stay here.”

Eirik, ever the voice of reason, interjected before the debate could escalate. “We can squabble over sleeping arrangements later. We’re not sleeping right now anyway. Let’s take a short rest before the games begin. Perhaps everyone can retire and study, or practice squats and lifting, like Corman.” His tone was light, but his words carried a clear message: focus on the task at hand.

Corman, eager to prepare, immediately began stretching against a nearby sword rack, his movements deliberate and intense. He looked like one of those overly enthusiastic runners before a race, decked out in full gear and taking the warm-up far too seriously. His focus was unwavering as he prepared himself for the upcoming strength competition.

The others followed suit, each making their own preparations. Thalrok took a moment to meditate, drawing strength from the natural world even in this desolate place. Eirik engaged in light training, sharpening his skills in anticipation of the single combat event. Bog, ever the pragmatist, simply lounged in a corner, confident in his abilities and uninterested in over-exerting himself before the games.

Nitya, meanwhile, found herself famished after her long ordeal in the tower. She made her way to the dining area, where she observed the devils uncorking small glasses that emitted strange, eerie screams. They sipped the screams as they spoke in a hissing tongue that she couldn’t understand. Intrigued, she decided to cast a ritual spell, Comprehend Languages, to eavesdrop on their conversation.

As the spell took effect, Nitya began to pick up fragments of their discussion. The devils were negotiating over the quality of the souls found in the pit, debating whether they met the standards of their infernal contracts. It was a business lunch of sorts, with the devils meticulously reviewing contracts and discussing the value of the souls they were trafficking. Nitya listened intently, her mind racing as she pieced together the infernal politics at play.

Back in the main room, the group reconvened after their short rest. The time had come to decide which event they would participate in first. The Thayan Games offered two options: the Defense of Thaymount, a group arena combat, or single combat, which would pit Eirik against another contestant in a brutal one-on-one fight.

Thalrok, ever the strategist, weighed the options carefully. “We should enter the group event,” he suggested. “We’ve trained together, and we’ll have a better chance of winning if we work as a team.”

Corman, still stretching, nodded in agreement. “I’m ready to crush whatever they throw at us.”

Eirik, though confident in his abilities, agreed that the group event might be the best choice for now. “We’ll face the single combat soon enough,” he said. “For now, let’s focus on the Defense of Thaymount.”

With their decision made, the group steeled themselves for the challenges ahead. The Thayan Games were about to begin, and the stakes had never been higher. Each of them knew that victory in the arena could mean the difference between life and death—not just for themselves, but for the many souls trapped in the Pit of Eternal Servitude.

The tension in the air was palpable as the group entered the Grand Arena, the roar of the crowd crashing over them like a tidal wave. The arena was a vast, sprawling coliseum, filled with spectators of all kinds—humans, devils, undead, and other creatures of Thay, all eager for the bloodshed to come. The adventurers were ushered through the winding corridors beneath the arena, the atmosphere thick with the hum of powerful magic. Nitya and Eirik could feel the arcane energy pulsing through the walls, as if the very structure of the arena was shifting and preparing for the spectacle.

As they reached a small holding area, the group gathered for a final moment of preparation. Eirik paced back and forth, his mind already focused on the upcoming battle. He had psyched himself up for this, ready to face whatever challenge the Thayan Games threw at him. Thalrok, the goliath druid, stood tall and calm, his deep voice breaking the silence. "Eirik, are you ready?"

Eirik didn’t respond with words. His mind was already in the arena, his focus unshakable. He simply nodded, his grip tightening around his warhammer, Gravebreaker. Corman, the human paladin, stepped forward, his voice filled with earnest conviction. "Hey, Cuh, I’m praying for you," he said, offering a brief but heartfelt blessing. Thalrok, ever the pragmatist, added with a smirk, "Good, because you’re going."

Eirik strode forward, his boots echoing against the stone floor as the door swung open before him. The roar of the crowd intensified as he stepped into the arena, the harsh sunlight casting long shadows over the bloodstained sand. The stands were packed with spectators, and high above, in a box protected by a shimmering force field, sat the Tharkion herself, surrounded by Red Wizards and other high-ranking officials. The crowd’s energy was electric, a mixture of anticipation and bloodlust.

The Tharkion’s voice boomed across the arena, silencing the crowd for a moment. "Here we bring in the inaugural first day of the glorious Thayan Games within the city of Cirthe and Lesvath. In days long past, single combat has marked the bloody history of Thay and its dominion over the weak. Today, we see the first single combat shall be a foreign westerner." At this, the crowd erupted into boos, their disdain for the outsider palpable. The Tharkion continued, her voice rising above the noise. "And the Bonebreaker himself, Korlash!"

A massive orc stepped into the arena, his presence commanding immediate attention. Clad in plate armor, with a belt of throwing axes and potions strapped to his waist, Korlash was every bit the warrior his reputation suggested. A greatsword hung at his side, and as he raised it to the sky, he bellowed, "For Zaztam! Death to the Westerner!" The crowd roared in approval, their bloodlust ignited.

Eirik, unfazed by the orc’s bravado, dragged Gravebreaker across the ground, the weapon’s weight making a hissing sound as it scraped against the sand. In Orcish, he called out, "Krodum Thrak, let’s see if your strength matches your roar." The orc sneered in response, but Eirik’s challenge had been made.

From their seats above, the rest of the group watched with bated breath. Corman leaned over to Thalrok and Bog, whispering, "Do you think he’s got what it takes?" Thalrok, his gaze fixed on the arena, replied with a dry chuckle, "We’ve already seen how orcs fare in the games." His quip earned a round of laughter from the group, though Corman, not fully understanding the joke, laughed along awkwardly.

Nitya, observing the orc from a distance, nudged Corman. "Is that him? Is that your friend, Henk?" Corman shook his head, his voice solemn. "No, that’s not Henk. Henk was... delicate. This orc is a brute."

In the arena, Eirik made his first move. He sidestepped quickly, positioning himself behind one of the massive stone pillars that dotted the battlefield. His eyes darted to the throwing axes strapped to Korlash’s belt, recognizing the danger they posed. He wanted to draw the orc in, to confuse him, and force him into a more vulnerable position. As he moved, Eirik channeled magic through Gravebreaker, casting False Life on himself. The arcane energy surged through his body, bolstering his vitality with temporary hit points.

Korlash, seeing Eirik take cover, sneered and hefted one of his throwing axes. The orc’s brute strength was evident as he hurled the weapon with deadly precision, aiming to flush Eirik out from behind the pillar. The axe slammed into the stone with a resounding thud, missing Eirik by inches but sending a clear message—there would be no hiding in this fight.

The crowd roared with approval as the battle began in earnest. From their vantage point, the adventurers could see the intensity in Eirik’s movements, the calculated strategy behind every step. But Korlash was no mere brute; he was a seasoned warrior, and his every move was filled with purpose.

Corman, watching intently, whispered another prayer under his breath. "Lathander, guide his hand." Thalrok, ever the realist, simply watched, his expression unreadable. Bog, leaning back in his seat, grinned. "I’d hate to be that orc right now."

As the battle raged on, Eirik knew that this was no ordinary fight. The Thayan Games were a brutal test of strength, skill, and endurance. But he was ready. He had trained for this, prepared for this, and with Gravebreaker in hand, he would show the crowd—and Korlash—that the Westerner was no weakling.

The first clash between the two warriors was imminent, and the crowd’s anticipation reached a fever pitch. The Thayan Games had begun, and the outcome of this battle would set the tone for the bloody days to come.

The crowd’s roar echoed through the arena as Eirik Thorne squared off against Korlash, the Bonebreaker. The orc, a hulking figure of brutal strength, hurled a series of throwing axes with deadly precision. The first axe landed at Eirik’s feet, sending a spray of sand into the air. The second was barely deflected by Eirik’s shield, and the third whizzed past him, missing by inches. Korlash, undeterred, let out a thunderous roar and charged forward, drawing his massive greatsword, the weight of the weapon dragging slightly in the sand as he closed the distance.

Eirik, unfazed by the orc’s display of brute force, laughed in the face of his opponent. With a swift motion, he swung his warhammer, Gravebreaker, aiming to land a crushing blow. But Korlash was no novice; with a practiced twist of his body, he used his impregnable counter technique, deflecting Gravebreaker’s momentum and attempting to trip Eirik in the process. Eirik, however, was prepared. Drawing on his tactical mind, he adjusted his stance, countering the orc’s attempt and maintaining his footing. 

The two warriors circled each other, their eyes locked in a deadly dance. Eirik seized the opportunity and swung Gravebreaker again, this time connecting with Korlash’s side. The blow sent the orc staggering, his attempt to counter leaving him vulnerable. With a thunderous crash, Korlash toppled to the ground, the crowd erupting in a mix of cheers and jeers.

Seeing his opponent down, Eirik let out a primal scream, his voice cutting through the noise of the arena. He activated his Action Surge, his body surging with renewed energy. With Gravebreaker raised high above his head, he swung down with all his might, aiming to crush Korlash where he lay. The orc, dazed and winded, barely managed to roll aside, the hammer slamming into the sand beside him. Eirik spat at his fallen opponent, his face twisted in a mocking grin. 

From the stands, Thalrok leaned over to Corman, his voice laced with amusement. “You can’t triple-stamp a double-stamp,” he quipped, watching the back-and-forth exchange between the two combatants. Bog, meanwhile, let out a hearty laugh as he watched Korlash struggle to stay on his feet. 

Korlash, not one to stay down for long, scrambled to his feet and swung his greatsword in a wide arc, aiming for Eirik’s midsection. The blade whistled through the air, but Eirik was quick, dodging the strike with ease. The orc followed up with a spinning backhand, a move that had become his signature, but once again, Eirik was too fast, sidestepping the blow and grinning at the crowd as if to say, *Is this the best Thay has to offer?*

Corman, watching from the stands, pounded his hands against the rails, shouting encouragement. “Come on, Eirik! Show them what you’re made of!” His voice was drowned out by the roar of the crowd, but the sentiment was clear. Eirik, fueled by the energy of the arena, swung Gravebreaker in an upward arc, aiming for Korlash’s chin. The orc, caught off guard, was sent sprawling to the ground once more.

Eirik, ever the showman, raised his arms to the crowd, basking in their mixed reactions. “Are you not entertained?!” he bellowed, his voice booming across the arena. The crowd responded with a cacophony of cheers and boos, their bloodlust growing with each passing moment.

But Korlash wasn’t finished yet. With a quick motion, the orc produced a small scroll from his belt and muttered an incantation. In an instant, his form shimmered and vanished, the orc using a Misty Escape to teleport 60 feet away, invisible to the naked eye. Eirik, sensing the orc’s cowardice, sneered. “Is this the might of Thay? An orc who runs and hides?” he shouted, his voice dripping with disdain.

The crowd murmured in confusion, unsure of where Korlash had disappeared to. Eirik, ever confident, cast Blade Ward on himself, his body glowing faintly with protective magic. “Show yourself, coward!” he yelled, his voice echoing through the arena.

Suddenly, Korlash reappeared beside him, his greatsword swinging in a deadly arc. The blade, enhanced by the orc’s invisibility, should have struck true, but Eirik’s reflexes were too sharp. He dodged the attack, his magic and agility working in tandem to deflect the blow. Korlash, now desperate, unleashed a flurry of wild strikes, his spinning backfists missing their mark time and again. The orc’s frustration was evident, his eyes wide with fear as he realized he was outmatched.

Eirik, sensing the orc’s desperation, laughed and hurled insults in Orcish. With a final, powerful swing of Gravebreaker, he knocked Korlash to the ground once again. The orc, now lying prone in the sand, looked up at Eirik with a mixture of rage and terror. Eirik placed his foot on Korlash’s chest, pinning him to the ground as he raised his hammer for the finishing blow. But the strike missed, the hammer slamming into the sand beside the orc’s head. Eirik chuckled to himself, his arrogance getting the better of him. “Maybe I should stop being so pompous,” he muttered under his breath.

Korlash, seizing the opportunity, attempted to use his impregnable counter once more, but Eirik was ready. With a quick adjustment, he dodged the orc’s grasp and swung Gravebreaker again, knocking Korlash back to the ground. The two warriors circled each other, the orc gasping for breath, clearly exhausted. 

From the stands, Corman turned to Thalrok and Bog. “Do you think Eirik will let him yield?” he asked, his voice filled with genuine curiosity. Bog, ever the cynic, shook his head. “Not a chance. Eirik’s going to kill him for sure.”

Korlash, now on his last legs, attempted to flee, but Eirik was too quick. With a swift motion, he struck the orc with an opportunity attack, knocking him to the ground once more. Korlash, desperate and out of options, swung his greatsword wildly from his prone position, but it was clear that the fight was over. His attacks were weak, his movements sluggish. The orc’s eyes were wide with fear, his once-mighty form reduced to a gasping, flailing mess.

Corman, watching the scene unfold, called out to Eirik. “Let him yield, Eirik! He’s done!” But Eirik, his blood still pumping from the thrill of battle, wasn’t ready to end it just yet.

The crowd, sensing the orc’s impending defeat, roared with anticipation. The Thayan Games had claimed another victim, and Eirik Thorne stood victorious, his hammer raised high, ready to deliver the final blow.

The crowd's anticipation reached a fever pitch as Eirik Thorne stood over the defeated orc, Korlash Bonebreaker, his warhammer, Gravebreaker, still dripping with the black blood of his fallen foe. The arena, once filled with cheers and jeers, fell into a stunned silence as the might of Mithdranor surged through Eirik’s veins. He raised his hammer high, reciting ancient words in Elvish, invoking the power of his ancestors. The crowd, sensing something momentous, grew uneasy, their voices fading into a quiet murmur. 

With a final, booming strike, Eirik brought Gravebreaker down upon Korlash’s face, the force of the blow amplified by the arcane energy of Booming Blade. The orc’s skull shattered under the weight of the hammer, and a sickening silence fell over the arena. The once-boisterous crowd now seemed uncertain, as if they had just witnessed something they were not prepared for. Whispers of disbelief rippled through the stands—an upset, a humiliation for Thay. The Westerner had triumphed.

Eirik stood over Korlash’s lifeless body, the black blood pooling at his feet, and for a moment, the entire arena seemed to hold its breath. Then, slowly, the crowd began to boo, their disappointment and anger at the defeat of their champion palpable. Eirik, however, was unmoved. He stepped toward the Tharkion, the ruler of this cruel land, and knelt before her in a gesture of respect. Rising to his feet, he locked eyes with her, his expression unreadable.

The Tharkion, her face impassive, gestured with a single finger, and a bronze laurel—known as the Bone Laurel—was presented to Eirik. This was the prize for his victory in single combat, a symbol of his triumph in the Thayan Games. Eirik stepped forward, taking the laurel without hesitation. He then turned back to Korlash’s body, his expression hardening. With a swift motion, he reached down and ripped one of the orc’s tusks from his mouth, a grisly trophy of his victory.

As Eirik rejoined his companions, the black-robed figures of Goros, the Thark who had sponsored Korlash, approached the group. Their faces were twisted with fury, their pride wounded by the defeat of their champion. One of the bald women, a Red Wizard, hissed through clenched teeth, “This insult will not go unanswered. We will see you in the arena again, Westerners.”

Eirik, undeterred by their threats, raised the tusk of Korlash and dragged it across his own throat in a mocking gesture, signaling the fate that awaited them. The Thark’s followers spat insults in broken Common, their voices filled with venom. "You will all be slaves!" they shouted, their rage barely contained. But Eirik remained calm, his eyes cold and unyielding.

Thalrok, the Goliath druid, couldn’t resist adding to the tension. He looked at the Red Wizard and her companions, a smirk playing on his lips. “Looks like you’ve got enough hair for the three of you,” he taunted, referencing the bald heads of the Thayans. “Soon, you’ll meet the same fate as Korlash.”

Corman, ever the loyal companion, burst into laughter, his voice booming across the arena. “That’s the funniest thing I’ve heard all day!” he cackled, his laughter echoing like that of a high school bully’s sidekick. Meanwhile, Nitya, the group’s newest recruit, distanced herself from the taunts and jeers. She lived in Thay, after all, and knew better than to provoke the ire of its powerful denizens.

As the Thark’s group retreated, the adventurers were summoned once more to the arena. This time, they would face the legendary Defense of Thaymount, a challenge that would test not just their strength, but their unity as a team.

Eirik, still riding the high of his victory, downed a healing potion as the group gathered in the lower tunnels of the arena. The air was thick with anticipation, and the roar of the crowd above could be heard even through the stone walls. Corman, ever the devout paladin, approached Eirik, his voice filled with reverence. “Eirik, which gods do you worship? They clearly favored you in that battle.”

Eirik, still panting from the adrenaline of the fight, scoffed at the notion of divine intervention. “I worship no gods,” he replied, his voice steady. “I forge my own path and my own destiny. It’s me, and Gravebreaker.”

Thalrok, amused by Eirik’s response, reached out for a bro shake, gripping Eirik’s forearm with a firm grasp. “Gravebreaker did great,” the Goliath said with a grin. “And you did alright as well.”

Eirik returned the gesture, though his mind was still racing from the fight. He paced back and forth, like a man who had just walked out of a bar brawl, still amped up from the rush of combat. Bog, ever the practical one, handed Eirik a beer. “Here,” he said with a grin. “Victory drink. This’ll calm your nerves.”

At that moment, a grand horn sounded, signaling the next event. The gate before them opened, and the group stepped out into the arena once more. The battlefield had shifted, its shape now dominated by a large, collapsed altar made of skulls. Above them, vultures circled ominously, their shadows flitting across the sand.

The Tharkion’s voice boomed across the arena, silencing the crowd. “Behold, the second event! Honored citizens of Thay, today we witness the Defense of Thaymount. In days long past, when Thaymount, the heart of our power, was threatened by those who envied our strength, our ancestors stood defiant. Before the towering spires of our mountain home, they defended the very altar to Zaztam against waves of relentless invaders.”

The crowd erupted into cheers as the Tharkion continued. “Today, these Westerners will face a challenge that echoes the valor of those times. Their mission is to defend this altar from the ferocious Crimson Legion, wild beasts from distant lands. Should the altar fall, they will forfeit this event. But if they succeed, they will be awarded the Black Obelisk.”

The adventurers exchanged glances, their resolve hardening. The task before them was clear: defend the altar at all costs. The first wave of enemies would soon descend upon them, and they would need every ounce of strength, cunning, and teamwork to survive.

As the crowd roared in anticipation, Eirik, Corman, Thalrok, Bog, and Nitya took their positions around the altar. The Defense of Thaymount had begun, and the fate of the Black Obelisk—and their lives—hung in the balance.

The arena buzzed with anticipation as the adventurers took their positions around the altar. The Defense of Thaymount had begun, and the stakes were high. Corman, ever the devout paladin, knelt in a prayer-like stance at the top of the ramp, staring toward the east gate. His armor shimmered as he invoked his Stoneborn Carapace, the stone plates forming over his skin like the armor of a mythical titan. With a slow, deliberate motion, he stood, his longsword now glowing with the power of *Magic Weapon*. The crowd roared in approval, admiring the spectacle of his transformation.

Eirik Thorne, the human fighter, prepared himself as well. He cast *Blade Ward*, his body momentarily glowing with protective energy. He took up a position near Nitya, the newest member of their group, ready to strike any foe that ventured too close. The tension was palpable as they waited for the signal to begin.

Bog, the satyr monk, downed the last of his beer with a hearty slap to his chest, psyching himself up for the battle ahead. He eyed the strange trees that had sprung up around the arena with suspicion, their rope-like tentacles hanging ominously. Deciding against climbing them, he moved to the stairs, readying himself to strike any beast that dared approach.

Nitya, the human wizard, was less patient. She stood tapping her foot, clearly unimpressed with the theatrics of her companions. "This is what years of hard work and study will get you," she muttered under her breath before stepping forward and unleashing a devastating *Fireball*. The spell exploded across the east side of the arena, engulfing several of the great apes in a fiery inferno. The smaller apes were instantly incinerated, reduced to ash, while one of the massive trees was nearly obliterated by the blast. The larger ape, however, survived the explosion, though it was clearly enraged by the attack.

The gates to the east and west burst open, and the crowd let out a collective gasp as the enormous forms of great apes charged into the arena. Behind them, a King Kong-sized behemoth lumbered forward, its body adorned with strange devices that glinted ominously in the sun. The Tharkion’s voice echoed through the stadium: “Welcome the Twin Crimson!” The challenge had officially begun.

Eirik, ever the tactician, held his position by Nitya, ready to strike. He watched as the first of the apes charged forward, hurling rocks in a display of primal aggression. The rocks slammed into the ground around them, but they were poorly aimed, and the adventurers remained unharmed. Corman, in his newly fortified form, stood resolute, prepared to meet the oncoming horde.

Thalrok, the goliath druid, had been momentarily distracted by the size of the trees and the chaos of the battle. He considered casting *Call Lightning*, but hesitated, his mind racing with tactical decisions. He knew they had to be careful—the arena was filled with traps, both magical and physical, and the beasts were relentless.

As the apes advanced, the largest one, furious at the loss of its kin, hurled a strange device toward the group. It landed with a heavy thud, and for a moment, the adventurers braced themselves for an explosion. But Nitya, ever quick on her feet, used her *Portent* ability to alter the outcome of the roll. The device fizzled harmlessly, much to the ape’s frustration.

Bog, ever wary of Thay’s treachery, kept his distance from the strange trees. He had originally intended to climb them, but something about their rope-like appendages made him uneasy. Instead, he took up a defensive position near the stairs, ready to unleash a flurry of blows on any beast that came too close.

The battle was in full swing now. The apes, though formidable, were clearly unnerved by the explosion that had decimated their ranks. They hurled rocks wildly, their aim faltering in the face of Nitya’s devastating magic. The largest ape, still enraged, attempted to mimic its smaller counterparts, hurling another device toward the group. But once again, the adventurers were ready, and the attack failed to land.

Corman, his body now encased in stone-like armor, stood tall and defiant. His glowing longsword gleamed as he prepared to meet the charge of the great apes. “For Lathander!” he shouted, his voice ringing out across the arena. The crowd, though divided in their loyalties, couldn’t help but be impressed by the paladin’s resolve.

Eirik, ever the strategist, kept his focus on the battlefield. He knew that the larger ape was the true threat, and he was ready to strike when the time came. His eyes flicked to Nitya, who was muttering to herself in frustration. The fireball had been powerful, but she was clearly disappointed that the larger ape had survived. “I should’ve aimed higher,” she grumbled under her breath.

The apes, now fully committed to their assault, charged toward the altar, their massive forms casting long shadows over the battlefield. The adventurers braced themselves for the onslaught, their weapons at the ready. The Defense of Thaymount had begun in earnest, and the fate of the Black Obelisk—and their survival—hung in the balance.

As the apes closed in, the group knew they would need to rely on both their individual strengths and their teamwork to prevail. The battle was far from over, and the next wave of enemies would undoubtedly be even more dangerous. But for now, they stood united, ready to defend the altar and prove their worth in the Thayan Games.

The crowd’s roar grew louder, their bloodlust palpable. The adventurers could feel the weight of their expectations pressing down on them. This was not just a fight for survival—it was a test of their skill, their resolve, and their ability to work as a team. And in the brutal land of Thay, failure was not an option.

The battle for the Defense of Thaymount raged on, the arena filled with the deafening roar of the crowd and the primal howls of the great apes. The adventurers, positioned around the crumbling altar, braced themselves for the onslaught. The apes, massive and red-furred, had come prepared for more than just brute force. From atop the towering trees that dotted the battlefield, they hurled bombs and rocks with terrifying precision, their tactics far more advanced than the group had anticipated.

Thalrok, the Goliath druid, was the first to react. He glanced at Nitya, the wizard, who had already unleashed a devastating fireball that had scorched the battlefield. “You missed one,” he said with a smirk, before calling upon the storm. His tattoos glowed a brilliant blue as he summoned a bolt of lightning from the heavens. The crackling energy struck the tree where one of the largest apes had taken refuge, sending sparks flying. The ape, nimble despite its size, swung to a neighboring branch just in time to avoid the full force of the strike. The tree, however, was not so lucky, its bark sizzling and smoking from the impact. 

Not content to remain on the ground, Thalrok shifted his form, transforming into a massive hornet. His body shimmered as he took to the skies, buzzing menacingly above the battlefield. The sight of the enormous insect, dwarfing even the largest of the apes, drew gasps from the crowd. Thalrok flew up 40 feet, surveying the battlefield from above, ready to rain down more destruction.

Eirik Thorne, ever the warrior, charged forward with Gravebreaker in hand. He sprinted toward one of the smaller apes, his warhammer swinging in a deadly arc. The blow connected with a sickening crunch, shattering the creature’s ribcage and sending it sprawling to the ground. Without missing a beat, Eirik sidestepped toward another ape, his adrenaline surging. He brought Gravebreaker down once more, the hammer crushing his second target with brutal efficiency. As the ape’s lifeless body hit the sand, Eirik turned to Bog, the satyr monk, and shouted, “Get in this fight!”

Bog, always one for theatrics, slapped his chest in approval, the roar of the crowd fueling his excitement. He had been hanging back, but seeing Eirik’s display of strength ignited something within him. With a whoop, he sprinted toward the fray, his arms raised to hype up the audience. He ran in a full sprint, his body leaning forward like a runner in a race, fist cocked back and ready to strike. At the last moment, he unleashed a powerful punch, his knuckles connecting with one of the apes. The creature staggered, but Bog wasn’t finished. He spun around, aiming another strike, but this one missed its mark. Frustrated, he unleashed a flurry of blows, his fists a blur as he pummeled the ape. With his final strike, he disengaged, retreating back to the altar to protect it from further harm.

Meanwhile, Corman, the human paladin, had his eyes set on the largest of the apes. Clad in his stone armor, his sword glowing with divine energy, he raised his weapon high and shouted, “For Lathander and the Lord’s Alliance!” Charging forward, he aimed to strike at the massive creature, but the ape was perched 30 feet up in a tree, just out of reach. Undeterred, Corman channeled his divine power into a *Guiding Bolt*, aiming to blast the ape from its perch. However, his inexperience with ranged magic showed, and the bolt flew wide, missing its target. The ape, sensing Corman’s frustration, taunted him with a mocking gesture, but Corman remained resolute. He raised his sword once more, shouting at the creature to come down and face him.

Nitya, ever the pragmatic spellcaster, stepped forward and offered Corman a suggestion. “Perhaps a technique like this would be more effective,” she said, before unleashing a well-aimed *Firebolt*. The spell hit its mark, striking the tree and causing the ape to lose its balance. With a startled screech, the creature plummeted 30 feet to the ground, landing hard and taking significant damage. Nitya, satisfied with her work, cast *Arcane Vigor* to restore some of her companions’ health, ensuring they could continue the fight.

The apes, though battered, were far from defeated. One of the smaller creatures, enraged by the fall of its comrade, charged at Bog, its massive fists swinging wildly. Bog, quick on his feet, dodged the attack with ease, his movements fluid and precise. Another of the apes attempted to grapple Eirik, but the seasoned fighter was too quick, sidestepping the creature’s clumsy attempt. Frustrated, the ape hurled a rock at Eirik, but the projectile missed, crashing harmlessly into the sand.

The largest of the apes, still perched in its tree, hurled another bomb toward the altar. The explosive device landed dangerously close to Corman, but he managed to avoid the worst of the blast. The altar, however, took more damage, its ancient stone cracking under the assault. The ape, clearly frustrated by its poor aim, let out a furious roar and prepared to throw another bomb.

As the battle raged on, the adventurers knew they had to act quickly. The apes were relentless, and the altar’s defenses were weakening. But they were not without hope. Thalrok, now in his hornet form, buzzed overhead, ready to strike from above. Eirik, Bog, and Corman held the line, their weapons gleaming in the harsh sunlight. And Nitya, ever the tactician, prepared her next spell, determined to turn the tide in their favor.

The Defense of Thaymount was far from over, but the adventurers stood strong, united in their resolve. The fate of the altar—and their victory in the Thayan Games—hung in the balance.

As the chaotic battle continued in the arena, the adventurers found themselves locked in a deadly struggle against the Crimson Legion of apes. The once-pristine sand was now littered with debris, the remnants of bombs and rocks hurled by the enraged apes. The crowd watched with bated breath, their bloodlust palpable as the adventurers fought for their lives.

Corman stood at the forefront, his armor gleaming under the harsh sunlight. The stone plates of his *Stoneborn Carapace* shimmered as he braced himself for the next attack. Despite the tension, there was a strange calm about him. His faith in Lathander burned brightly, and he knew that with his divine power, he could hold the line. A massive ape hurled a bomb at his feet, but once again, the creature’s aim was off. The explosive device skittered uselessly across the sand, drawing a few chuckles from the crowd. Corman, undeterred, looked up at the towering ape and muttered a prayer, his sword glowing with divine energy.

Nearby, Eirik Thorne was in the thick of it, his warhammer *Gravebreaker* swinging with deadly precision. He had already dispatched two of the smaller apes with brutal efficiency, and now his eyes were set on the larger one. The ape, enraged by the loss of its kin, attempted to bite and slam Eirik with its fists, but the seasoned fighter dodged each attack with ease. Even a last-ditch attempt by the ape’s strange, vestigial tail to strike him failed miserably. Eirik grinned, his confidence growing with each missed attack. "These apes can’t hit anything," he muttered, his voice filled with disdain.

Thalrok, in his massive hornet form, buzzed ominously above the battlefield. He had swooped down earlier, catching one of the apes in his mandibles and delivering a devastating bite. The sight was something out of a nightmare—like a scene from a battle between Godzilla and King Kong. The crowd gasped as the giant hornet dwarfed its simian foe, the ape barely able to withstand the onslaught. Thalrok’s mandibles pierced the creature’s flesh, and with a sickening crunch, he sent it sprawling. The ape, clearly outmatched, lay prone on the ground, struggling to rise. Thalrok, sensing victory, hovered menacingly above it, ready to strike again.

From his vantage point, Eirik saw the opportunity to finish the ape. With a mighty swing of *Gravebreaker*, he aimed for the creature’s jaw, but somehow, the ape managed to twist its head just in time. The hammer missed by inches, slamming into the ground with a dull thud. Eirik cursed under his breath, frustrated by the near miss. Before he could strike again, the ape’s vine-like appendages shot out, pulling it back up into the safety of the trees. "Arboreal Tactician," Eirik growled, recognizing the creature’s ability to escape. He watched as the ape climbed 30 feet into the air, laughing mockingly from its perch. 

Bog, the satyr monk, was not one to be left out of the action. He had been hanging back, but seeing the chaos unfold, he decided it was time to make his move. With a wild grin, he sprinted toward the fray, his hooves kicking up sand as he closed the distance. His fists flew in a blur, pummeling one of the smaller apes with a flurry of blows. The creature staggered under the assault, but Bog wasn’t finished. He delivered a final, powerful punch before disengaging, retreating back to the altar to prepare for the next wave.

Meanwhile, Corman had an idea. He glanced at Thalrok, who was still in his hornet form, and a mischievous grin spread across his face. Without a word, he jumped onto Thalrok’s back, gripping the giant insect’s thorax tightly. "Let’s take this fight to the skies," he muttered, reaching into one of Thalrok’s bags. Inside, he found the ballista—a weapon Henk had used before. With a fond memory of his fallen companion, Corman began fumbling with the device, trying to set it up on Thalrok’s back. It was a comical sight—Corman, like a caveman with a radio, banging on the ballista in an attempt to make it work.

Thalrok, despite his massive size, buzzed in amusement. "I’m huge, bro," he muttered, his voice distorted by his insect form. The crowd watched in awe as the paladin and druid-turned-hornet prepared for aerial combat. Corman, still struggling with the ballista, used his *Lay on Hands* to heal Thalrok, restoring some of the damage the druid had taken earlier. "Well done, Thalrok," Corman said, patting the giant hornet on the side. 

As Corman continued to tinker with the ballista, Thalrok, now fully healed and mounted with the weapon, made eye contact with a figure in the stands—Miranda. His eyes narrowed, and with a voice filled with menace, he shouted, "Look what you’ve done. You’re next." Miranda, her face stone-cold, watched the spectacle unfold with steely eyes.

Nitya, meanwhile, was growing impatient. She raised her oaken staff and unleashed another *Firebolt*, this time aiming for the tree where the giant ape had taken refuge. The bolt struck the tree with precision, sending splinters flying. The ape, caught off guard, screeched in anger, but it was clear that it was running out of options. Nitya smirked, satisfied with her handiwork.

The battle for the Defense of Thaymount was far from over, but the adventurers had gained the upper hand. The apes, though ferocious, were no match for the combined might of the group. With Corman and Thalrok taking to the skies, Eirik and Bog holding the line, and Nitya’s devastating magic, victory seemed within reach.

But the Crimson Legion was not defeated yet. The largest of the apes still lurked in the trees, and the adventurers knew that they would need to stay vigilant. The fate of the altar—and their success in the Thayan Games—hung in the balance.

The battle in the Colosseum raged on, with the adventurers locked in a desperate struggle to defend the altar from the relentless assault of the Crimson Legion apes. The air was thick with the acrid scent of smoke and blood, the ground littered with debris from the ape's thrown bombs and the remnants of shattered rocks. The crowd's cheers and jeers echoed through the arena, a cacophony of bloodlust and excitement that filled the air with tension.

Nitya, the human wizard, stood at the center of the battlefield, her eyes narrowed in concentration. With a flick of her wrist, she unleashed another *Firebolt*, the spell whispering through the air before striking one of the towering trees where an ape had taken refuge. The tree was nearly reduced to ash by the blast, and the ape teetered precariously, barely managing to hold on to the charred branches. The crowd gasped as the ape struggled to regain its balance.

Meanwhile, Bog, the satyr monk, was locked in combat with another ape. Too close for any fancy maneuvers, Bog swung his fists with brutal efficiency, landing blow after blow on the creature. His final strike hit with a sickening crunch, sending the ape crashing to the ground, blood pouring from its face as it slumped lifelessly on the stairs next to Eirik. Bog, breathing heavily, wiped the sweat from his brow and grinned. "I'll just stay right here for now," he muttered, ready for the next wave.

But the apes were far from finished. One of the larger creatures made a daring move, launching itself at Thalrok, the goliath druid who had transformed into a massive hornet. The ape bit and slammed at Thalrok, attempting to grapple him, but Nitya, ever the tactician, intervened. Using her *Portent* ability, she altered the outcome of the ape's grapple, ensuring that it failed to find purchase on Thalrok's insect hide. The ape, confused and frustrated, lashed out with its tail, but even that attack fell short.

The ape, clearly an arboreal tactician, performed an impressive cartwheel backflip off the top of the tree, landing near Nitya. Its massive form loomed over the altar, and with a furious roar, it began to lay into the stone structure, attempting to chip away at it. However, whether from exhaustion or sheer bad luck, the ape's attacks missed the altar entirely, its massive fists slamming into the ground instead.

Thalrok, still in his hornet form, buzzed above the battlefield, his wings beating a steady rhythm as he ascended to 30 feet. "Hold on!" he shouted to Corman, who was still perched precariously on his back, fumbling with the ballista. Thalrok dove down in a sweeping attack, calling upon the power of the storm once more. A bolt of lightning cracked through the air, landing just next to the altar and zapping the ape with a deafening boom. The creature screamed in agony, its ears ringing from the thunderous strike.

Eirik, ever the opportunist, seized the moment. He darted behind the ape, swinging *Gravebreaker* with all his might. The warhammer connected with the creature's knee, a loud pop echoing through the arena as the ape's ACL was torn apart. The ape staggered but somehow remained standing on one leg. Eirik, undeterred, swung again, this time aiming for the other leg. The blow connected, but the ape, through sheer force of will, refused to fall.

Meanwhile, Corman, still atop Thalrok, finally managed to figure out the ballista. With a triumphant shout, he aimed the weapon and fired. The ballista, designed for use in the Blood War, shot forth a series of laser-like bolts that struck the ape standing next to the altar. The creature howled in pain as the magical bolts tore through its flesh, leaving smoldering wounds in their wake.

Nitya, not one to be outdone, raised her staff and unleashed another bolt of fire, this time aiming for the ape that had been relentlessly attacking the altar. The spell hit its mark, and the ape let out a furious roar as the flames licked at its fur. Nitya, satisfied with her work, prepared for her next move.

Bog, seeing the ape attacking the altar, decided it was time to act. With a mighty leap, he used his satyr agility to vault over the altar, landing on the other side with a flourish. He swung his fists with deadly precision, but his first strike missed. Frustrated, he unleashed a flurry of blows, each one landing with increasing force. The ape, overwhelmed by the assault, finally collapsed, its blood spilling across the altar as its body fell limp.

With a triumphant grin, Bog dipped his finger in the ape's blood and wiped it across his face, a savage war-paint to mark his victory. He then moved to the other side of the altar, ready to face the next challenge.

But the battle was far from over. One of the remaining apes used its standing leap ability to bound across the battlefield, landing next to the altar. It raised its fists to the sky in a terrifying display of dominance, letting out a deafening roar that echoed through the arena. The crowd gasped as the ape began to slam its fists into the altar, determined to destroy it.

Thalrok, still in his hornet form, buzzed overhead, ready to strike. The adventurers knew that they had to act quickly—the altar was taking damage, and the apes were relentless in their assault. But they had fought too hard to give up now. With Corman manning the ballista, Eirik swinging *Gravebreaker*, and Nitya and Bog ready to unleash their next attacks, the adventurers prepared for the final push.

The Defense of Thaymount was nearing its climax, and the fate of the Black Obelisk—and the adventurers' survival—hung in the balance.

The arena was a cauldron of chaos, the crowd’s roars blending with the sounds of battle as Eirik, Corman, Nitya, Thalrok, and Bog fought to defend the altar at the heart of the Defense of Thaymount. The first wave of the Crimson Legion had been brutal, but the adventurers had held their ground, fending off the massive apes and their relentless bombardment of rocks and bombs. However, the fight had taken its toll—Eirik had been frozen in fear, unable to move closer to the enemy, and Corman had momentarily lost focus, his mind wandering to thoughts of pizza in the midst of the chaos.

Eirik had tried to shake off the effects of the fear gripping him, using his inspiration to reroll a wisdom save, but it hadn’t been enough. He stood like a stone, shuddering as the massive ape advanced on the altar. From his vantage point, Thalrok, still in his hornet form, swooped down and struck at the ape, his mandibles tearing into its flesh. The ape, now on its last legs, crawled desperately toward the altar, but Thalrok’s lightning strike brought it to its knees, barely able to continue its assault.

Eirik, still trembling, made another attempt to break free of the fear gripping him, and this time, he succeeded. Shaking himself out of his stupor, he turned his gaze toward the ape, now weakened and vulnerable. But before he could act, Nitya called out, “Fire the ballista!” Her voice cut through the noise of the arena, snapping Corman out of his reverie. He had been zoned out, lost in his thoughts, but now he focused, aiming the ballista toward the ape. His first shot missed, but with a frustrated growl, he adjusted his aim and fired again, narrowly missing once more.

Nitya, ever the pragmatic spellcaster, raised her staff and unleashed a *Firebolt* at the ape. The blast of arcane energy struck true, and the creature was finally dispatched. The group was given a brief moment of reprieve as the remaining trees in the arena crumbled into dust, leaving only the corpses of the massive apes behind. The adventurers exchanged weary glances, knowing that the next wave was imminent.

Eirik, always prepared, recast *Blade Ward* on himself, reinforcing his defenses. Nitya, ever resourceful, began patting down the corpses of the fallen apes, searching for any bombs or tools they might have left behind. Meanwhile, Corman, still perched atop Thalrok’s hornet form, waved his hand as if calling to a dog, instructing Thalrok to land on the west side of the arena. He positioned himself menacingly at the top of the stairs, readying the ballista for the next threat.

It wasn’t long before the ominous tones of the Tharchion’s voice echoed through the arena once more. Her words sent a chill through the adventurers as she introduced the next wave of enemies. “Once the foul legions of the Crimson had been slain, slithering masses, boiling herds of foul scavengers, beasts from across Thay, slithered into daylight.”

With a hiss, the gates at each entrance to the arena opened, and a menagerie of twisted creatures began to pour forth. To the south, a giant pangolin sneered at the adventurers, its body ready to roll into a ball and crush anything in its path. To the west, a twisted mass of ooze, covered in rotting weapons and armor, oozed its way toward the altar. And to the east, a steaming, hissing undead corpse stood alongside a giant parrot-like creature, both filled with a terrifying bloodlust.

The adventurers exchanged glances, their faces grim. They had barely survived the first wave, and now the second had arrived, more deadly and bizarre than before. The ground beneath their feet began to shift as swarms of bug-like flea monsters emerged from the sand, surrounding the arena’s edges. The group knew they had only moments to prepare before the next assault began.

Eirik tightened his grip on *Gravebreaker*, his eyes scanning the battlefield. Corman adjusted his aim on the ballista, ready to unleash its devastating power. Nitya’s mind raced as she calculated the best use of her spells, while Thalrok hovered above, ready to rain destruction from the skies. Bog, ever the opportunist, cracked his knuckles, eager to dive into the fray.

The next wave was upon them, and the adventurers knew they would need every ounce of strength and cunning to survive. As the beasts closed in, they rolled for initiative, their fates intertwined in the brutal spectacle of the Thayan Games.

And with that, the session came to a close, leaving the adventurers poised on the edge of another deadly confrontation. The Defense of Thaymount was far from over, and the next battle would test their resolve like never before.
