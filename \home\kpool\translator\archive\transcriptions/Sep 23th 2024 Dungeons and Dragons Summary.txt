The Thayan Games had begun with a flourish, a grand spectacle of music, dancing, and arcane displays. The party of adventurers—Corman, Henk, Bog, Eirik, and Thalrok—had arrived in the city of Lesvath, representing the Lord’s Alliance. Their journey had already been fraught with challenges, from battling undead in the Thayan barracks to a cryptic encounter with a devilish merchant. Now, standing amidst the throngs of competitors and spectators, they found themselves at a crossroads, their next steps uncertain.

Eirik, ever the vigilant fighter, took a moment to survey the stage where the competitors from the various Thayan regions had gathered. His keen eyes scanned the groups, noting the tension in the air. Conversations were hushed, guarded, and it was clear that camaraderie was not a priority here. These were rivals, not allies. One group, clad in vibrant blue, stood apart from the others, their solitude marking them as particularly enigmatic. Eirik’s brow furrowed as he considered the dynamics at play, wondering what alliances—or enmities—might form in the days ahead.

Meanwhile, Henk, the orcish politician with a flair for the dramatic, was not content to simply observe. With a mischievous grin, he turned to the group and declared, “Watch this.” Without waiting for a response, he leapt onto the stage with surprising agility for one of his size. His eyes locked on a bald woman from Team Gaara, and he strode confidently toward her, ignoring the curious glances from the other competitors.

Corman, the human paladin, watched from a distance, shaking his head in mild disbelief. “What in the Nine Hells are they doing?” he muttered under his breath, though he made no move to stop them. He had long since learned that Henk and Eirik had their own ways of handling situations—ways that often involved boldness and a disregard for social conventions.

Henk approached the woman, his eyes gleaming with a mix of curiosity and mischief. “May I get your name, my lady?” he asked, his voice dripping with mock chivalry. The woman responded in Thayan, her words sharp and hissing like the crackle of a fire. Though Henk didn’t understand the language, the tone of her voice made it clear that she was not impressed.

Before he could press further, a large orc—clearly a member of Team Gaara—stepped forward, placing a hand firmly on Henk’s chest. The gesture was unmistakable: *Do not go any further.* Henk, never one to back down from a challenge, reciprocated the gesture, placing his own hand on the orc’s chest. “Well met, brother greenskin,” he said with a grin, though the tension between the two warriors was palpable.

The orc, whom Eirik recognized as Korlash—a known competitor from Gaara—responded with a dismissive gesture, pushing Henk’s hand away as if dealing with an unruly patron at a tavern. Henk's grin faltered for a moment, but he quickly recovered, pulling out a piece of parchment and scribbling something on it. He didn’t know if Thay had addresses, but he did his best to provide directions to where he was staying. With a flourish, he folded the note and, finding no pockets on the woman, slipped it beneath her belt.

The woman’s expression twisted into one of disgust, but she did not stop him. Henk winked at her, clearly pleased with himself, before turning to Thalrok, the goliath druid who had joined him on the stage. “Baby steps, my Goliath friend,” Henk said with a smirk, as if imparting some great wisdom. Thalrok chuckled softly, shaking his head at the satyr’s antics.

As Henk made his exit, he let out a low, disdainful grunt in the direction of Korlash. Though he had greeted the orc with a semblance of respect, it was clear that Henk harbored a deep-seated hatred for his own kind—a hatred born of a past he rarely spoke of.

Eirik, who had followed Henk onto the stage, decided to take a different approach. Stepping up to Korlash, he spoke in the orcish tongue, a language he had learned during his travels across the Sword Coast. “May the best warrior win,” he said quietly, offering a nod of respect. Korlash, however, was not in the mood for pleasantries. He spat on the ground and muttered a single word in Thayan before turning and walking away, his disdain for the outsiders clear.

With the tension diffused—for now—Eirik rejoined the group, his mind already shifting to more practical matters. “Shall we check out the rest of the marketplace before we continue on our way?” he suggested, eager to move past the awkward encounter. Henk, still riding the high of his bold approach, nodded in agreement. “I need to pick up some bolts for my crossbow,” he added, as the group began to make their way toward the marketplace.

As they walked, the weight of the upcoming Games loomed over them. The competitors they had seen today were only the beginning. Many more challenges awaited them, both in the arena and beyond. But for now, they would prepare, gathering supplies and information as they ventured deeper into the heart of Thay.

The tense atmosphere between the party members had been simmering for a while, and it finally boiled over as they left the stage and made their way through the bustling marketplace. Corman, the ever-dutiful paladin, could no longer hold his tongue. He turned to Henk and Eirik, his brow furrowed with frustration. 

"What in the Nine Hells are you two doing?" Corman's voice was calm but carried the weight of his disapproval. "We're here to win, not to indulge in distractions. Every move you make risks putting the team in jeopardy."

Eirik, never one to back down from a challenge, grabbed a handful of Corman’s stone armor, his eyes narrowing as he stared the paladin down. "The only thing I'm here to do is win," he growled. "Can the same be said of you?"

Corman’s face tightened, but his resolve did not waver. "I swore oaths to bring glory to the good people of the world," he replied, his voice steady. "This is my one chance, and I’m taking it more seriously than ever. You shouldn’t indulge the orc with your... wanderings."

Eirik scoffed, releasing his grip on Corman’s armor. "We’ll see how devoted and glorious you are in the coming days," he muttered before turning away, his steps heavy as he walked off toward the back of the tented marketplace.

Henk, who had been watching the exchange with an amused grin, let out a hearty laugh. "The noises you’ll be hearing from my bedchamber, Corman—that’s winning. Not these silly games." The orc’s words dripped with mockery, and Corman could only shake his head in exasperation.

As Eirik disappeared into the crowd, Corman fell silent, his earlier fervor fading into a sullen acceptance. He had said his piece, but it seemed to have fallen on deaf ears. He glanced at Bog, the satyr monk who had been uncharacteristically quiet during the exchange.

"I’ve read stories about satyrs," Corman said, his voice low. "Creatures of great worldly lust. Are you on board with all this... fratty behavior?"

Bog, who had been lost in thought, looked up at Corman, his expression thoughtful. "A lot of what I once had as a suitor is long gone with my family," he replied, his voice soft yet firm. "But at heart, I still follow law and order. I’m used to surrounding myself with scum—worse than these red-armored undead. It’s not that I accept their behavior, but I’ve grown accustomed to it."

Corman nodded, though his heart remained heavy. He wasn’t sure if he had any true allies in this place, and the weight of that realization pressed down on him like a stone. Before he could dwell too long on his doubts, Thalrok, the goliath druid, stepped up beside him.

"I am here to win as well," Thalrok said, his deep voice rumbling like distant thunder. "To restore glory to my druid clan in the mountains."

Corman offered him a grateful nod. "Then help me," he said earnestly. "Help me keep Eirik and Henk in line. They’re going to jeopardize our victory if they keep this up."

Thalrok considered the request for a moment before replying. "I don’t think there’s any controlling Henk," he admitted. "But Eirik—Eirik can be an asset in the games ahead. We’ll need him."

Corman sighed, though he was grateful for Thalrok’s wisdom. "Thank you, my friend. Together, we’ll convince them to put the team first."

Bog, who had been listening quietly, finally spoke up. "Their boisterous attitude might actually benefit us," he said, his voice thoughtful. "There are a lot of eyes on us here, and a lot of people who want us dead. Them getting into people’s heads might be more beneficial than being silent competitors."

Corman wasn’t entirely convinced, but he appreciated the perspective. As they continued through the crowded marketplace, his eyes scanned the undead sentinels standing rigidly in their red armor, their hollow eyes staring into the distance. The eerie atmosphere of the Thayan city weighed heavily on him, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being watched.

Meanwhile, Eirik and Henk had made their way up a set of stone stairs, where they encountered Inquisitor Metis, the Thayan official assigned to oversee their activities. The Inquisitor’s cold, calculating gaze swept over them as he offered a brusque greeting in heavily accented Common.

"Ensure your registration is completed," Metis reminded them, his voice devoid of warmth.

Eirik nodded silently, not bothering to engage in conversation as they continued into the heart of the marketplace. The air was thick with the scent of exotic spices and the murmur of haggling voices. Vendors lined the streets, selling everything from enchanted apparel to strange, otherworldly trinkets. A scoreboard loomed overhead, displaying the standings of the various competitors in the Games.

As Eirik approached a peculiar vendor, a ghostly figure caught his eye. The spectral being held a large scroll that seemed to fold into nothingness, its spidery runes shifting and dancing before Eirik’s eyes. He felt a chill run down his spine, the scene reminding him of his past explorations in the ancient ruins of Myth Drannor.

Before Eirik could investigate further, Thalrok, who had wandered into the slave market, caught sight of Jorik—the same man from whom he had stolen an amulet days earlier. Jorik was surrounded by a group of flesh workers, their eyes gleaming with predatory intent. Thalrok instinctively tucked the stolen amulet deeper into his vest and backed away, deciding that now was not the time for confrontation.

As the group reconvened, the weight of their mission hung over them like a storm cloud. The Games were only just beginning, and already tensions were running high. But one thing was certain: they would either rise to glory together, or fall apart in the process.

The group gathered near the towering scoreboard, its intricate arcane symbols glowing faintly in the dim light. The air was thick with anticipation, and the grim faces of the Thayan audience only added to the weight of the moment. Eirik, ever the pragmatic fighter, scanned the board, noting the various challenges that awaited them. The tally keeper, a robed figure with a ghostly demeanor, unfurled a scroll and began listing the events for the first day of the games.

Eirik turned to the group, his voice carrying over the din of the marketplace. "We need to decide who partakes in each event." He quickly summarized the games: a team-based arena event, a single combat tournament, a necromantic rite, and a feat of strength. The group huddled closer, each weighing their strengths and weaknesses.

The first decision was the feat of strength. Corman, the paladin, stepped forward confidently. "I’ll take this one," he declared. His broad shoulders and muscular frame left little doubt that he was the best choice. "I’ve competed in Waterdeep’s regional strength competitions. Lifting weights, climbing ropes, carrying women in each arm—it’s what I’m here for."

Thalrok, the goliath druid, raised an eyebrow. "Are you sure that’s what these games will be like? This is Thay, after all."

Corman waved off the concern. "Strength is strength, no matter where you are. I’m ready."

Eirik chuckled at Corman’s bravado but nodded in agreement. "This is your chance for glory, Corman. We trust you to represent us well."

With a nod from the rest of the group, Corman approached the tally keeper. His confidence wavered slightly as he took the pen in hand. Writing was not his strong suit, but he managed to scrawl his name onto the scroll, hoping no one noticed his struggle. He returned to the group, his usual bravado restored.

Next came the necromantic rites, a contest that immediately made Corman uncomfortable. He spat on the ground in disgust. "I’ll have no part in that. Necromancy is vile, and I won’t even wish anyone luck who deals with it."

Eirik shot him a disapproving look. "That’s not the attitude of a winner, Corman. We need to face every challenge head-on, even the ones we don’t like."

The group turned to Henk, the orcish politician with a penchant for deception. Henk grinned slyly. "I’m no necromancer, but I’ve got a few tricks up my sleeve. I’m great at making people believe things that aren’t true."

Thalrok, ever the cautious one, pondered the challenge. "I can summon creatures, but they’re not undead. I can control the weather, manipulate people’s positions, but... I’m not sure any of that will help in this contest."

Henk, ever the showman, held out his hand, and a small, floating skull appeared, its hollow eyes glowing faintly. Thalrok blinked in surprise. "What the hell is that?"

Henk just laughed, his amusement clear. The rest of the group exchanged glances, unsure of what to make of the situation.

Corman threw his hands up in exasperation. "So it’s down to trusting our druid to tap into powers he’s never used before, or relying on the illusions of our deceptive orc. I don’t even know what to say."

Eirik, who had been watching the exchange with a calculating gaze, finally spoke. "My magic won’t help here. I’m out for this one." He looked at Henk, nodding slightly. "You’ve got my vote, Henk."

Thalrok, after a moment of contemplation, turned to Henk as well. "I believe in you. You’ve got this." Then, with a hint of challenge in his voice, he turned to Corman. "You don’t believe I can use my powers?"

Corman sighed, clearly frustrated by the whole situation. "It’s not that, Thalrok. It’s just... this whole thing feels off. But if you think Henk’s the right choice, then fine. Let’s do it."

With the decision made, Henk approached the tally keeper, his hand still playing with the floating skull. He scribbled his name onto the scroll for the necromantic rites, his grin never fading. The orc was clearly in his element, ready to deceive and manipulate his way to victory.

The group had made their choices, but the tension in the air remained. The first day of the games was fast approaching, and the weight of their decisions hung over them like a storm cloud. Each of them knew that the challenges ahead would test not only their physical and magical abilities but also their resolve as a team.

As they prepared to leave the marketplace, Eirik spoke up one last time. "Tomorrow, we fight. We’ve made our choices, and now we stand by them. Let’s show Thay what we’re made of."

Corman, still bristling from the earlier conversations, simply nodded. Thalrok remained stoic, his mind already turning to the challenges ahead. Henk, ever the trickster, gave a final wink to the group, his confidence unshaken.

The games were about to begin, and the fate of the Lord’s Alliance rested on their shoulders.

The group stood in the bustling marketplace of Thay, the weight of their upcoming challenges hanging in the air. They had just finished discussing who would represent the Lord’s Alliance in the various competitions of the Thayan Games. The choices had been made, but not without some debate.

Corman, the steadfast paladin, had initially shown his faith in Thalrok, the goliath druid, to handle the necromantic rites. However, after some deliberation, it was decided that Henk, the cunning orc politician, would be the one to take on that grim challenge. Henk’s knack for deception and misdirection seemed a better fit for the dark arts they would be dealing with. Corman had made his peace with it, though his distaste for necromancy was evident.

The conversation then shifted to the single combat tournament. Both Thalrok and Eirik, the human fighter, were strong contenders. Thalrok had proven his prowess in battle, especially when he took the form of a mighty bear and tore through undead foes. Eirik, on the other hand, was a seasoned warrior, wielding his fearsome warhammer, Gravebreaker, with deadly precision. The two exchanged glances, both knowing that only one of them could enter the arena.

Thalrok, ever the pragmatic, suggested they leave the decision to fate. “Perhaps we should roll on it,” he mused, a hint of a smile tugging at the corner of his lips. Corman, standing nearby, quickly chimed in, “Flip a coin, or better yet, roll a d20.”

Eirik, always one to enjoy a bit of chance, grinned widely and pulled out his dice bag. “A game of dice it is,” he said, clearing a small patch of ground and drawing a circle in the dirt. He tossed a die to Thalrok, who caught it with a nod. “Highest roll wins,” Eirik declared, the excitement evident in his voice.

With a flick of his wrist, Eirik’s die tumbled across the ground, landing with a disappointing *two*. He groaned, shaking his head in disbelief. Thalrok, with a calm and measured motion, rolled his own die. The result was a solid *seventeen*. The winds of fate had spoken.

Eirik bowed to Thalrok with a grin. “The dice have spoken in your favor, Stonefist,” he said, extending his hand for a congratulatory shake. Thalrok reached out, but instead of clasping Eirik’s hand, he grabbed the die that had fallen between them. “No, Eirik,” Thalrok said thoughtfully, “I think you should take the single combat.”

Eirik blinked, taken aback. “Why the change of heart?” he asked, puzzled.

Thalrok paused for a moment, reflecting on their recent battles. “I believe you’re our best chance to win in single combat,” he explained. “My abilities are more suited to fighting alongside others. You, however, thrive in one-on-one combat. We need to win, and I think you’re the one to do it.”

Eirik’s face lit up with excitement. He slammed Gravebreaker into the ground, the impact sending a small cloud of dust into the air, and grabbed Thalrok’s wrist in a hearty shake. “I’ll bring glory to myself and to this group,” he declared, his voice filled with determination. Without hesitation, he strode up to the tally keeper, a spectral figure holding a floating scroll, and penned his name into the slot for the single combat tournament.

With the decisions finalized, the tally keeper took the scroll back, allowing it to hover once more in the air. The group had chosen their champions: Henk for the necromantic rites, Corman for the feats of strength, and Eirik for the single combat. The next day, they would face their first challenge together—the Defense of Thaymount, a group event that would test their teamwork and resolve.

Bog, the satyr monk, threw his hands into the air with a grin. “Well, it’s settled then. Who wants a drink?” he asked, his jovial nature cutting through the tension that had been building.

Eirik chuckled and nodded. “A drink sounds good, but I’ve got some business to attend to first. I’ll meet you all at the Nameless Tavern,” he said, already turning to head off on his own errand.

Thalrok agreed with Bog. “There’s much to see in this city before the games begin,” he said, his eyes scanning the bustling marketplace. The goliath, ever curious, was eager to explore the strange and dangerous land of Thay.

As the others discussed their plans, Henk wandered off into the market, his mind set on finding some crossbow bolts. The Thayan merchants, clad in red robes, were not the most welcoming bunch. Most of them didn’t speak Common, and Henk found himself frustrated with their lack of communication. “For a society so well-versed in magic, you’d think they’d have learned to speak Common by now,” he muttered under his breath.

Despite the language barrier, Henk managed to communicate his needs through a series of gestures. He pointed to his crossbow and mimicked loading a bolt, then jingled his coin purse to show he was ready to pay. The merchant, understanding the request, gestured to a large board displaying the standings of the various competitors in the games. One of the spaces, marked in gray, belonged to the Lord’s Alliance.

Henk nodded, realizing that as a competitor, he had certain privileges. The merchant gave a gesture of open palms, indicating that Henk could take what he needed. With a satisfied grin, Henk selected several sturdy blackwood bolts and added them to his quiver.

As the group slowly reconvened, the reality of the games ahead began to sink in. They had chosen their champions, gathered their supplies, and now all that remained was to rest and prepare for the trials to come. The Thayan Games were about to begin in earnest, and the fate of the Lord’s Alliance rested on their shoulders.

The marketplace buzzed with energy, a chaotic blend of merchants hawking their wares and the constant hum of conversation. Eirik, ever the pragmatic fighter, scanned the tables for useful supplies. His eyes caught the sight of some poorly made potions of healing—yellowish glass vials with sediment swirling at the bottom. They didn’t look like the highest quality, but in Thay, you took what you could get. Grabbing two of the potions, Eirik pocketed them without hesitation, knowing they might come in handy in the days ahead.

Bog, the satyr monk, followed suit, picking up two potions of his own. “I’ve drunk worse,” he muttered with a grin, recalling some of the dubious brews he’d consumed in his past. Thalrok, the goliath druid, also grabbed two potions, remarking with a chuckle, “If we’re all doing it, might as well.”

As the group gathered their supplies, Henk, the orc politician, turned to Corman, the ever-disciplined paladin. “You got the strength in you, pretty boy?” he teased, his grin wide and full of mischief. 

Corman, never one to back down from a challenge, flexed his muscles with a dramatic grunt, his arms bulging in a display of strength. “I’ve got enough strength to carry this team to victory,” he said confidently, his voice booming over the din of the marketplace.

The group laughed as Corman’s bravado filled the air, but Bog’s attention was elsewhere. His keen satyr senses picked up the scent of something more potent than healing potions. “Any libations around here?” he asked, his eyes scanning the stalls for something stronger.

The Thayan merchants, however, seemed less than eager to engage with the satyr. They avoided eye contact, their faces tight with discomfort. Bog, undeterred, tried again, this time speaking in Infernal, the guttural language of devils. Yet even this failed to draw any interest, the Thayans only retreating further from his presence.

Thalrok, noticing Bog’s frustration, stepped up to one of the stalls and spotted a large glass container filled with a blackish-purple liquid. The yeasty smell suggested it was some kind of fermented drink, perhaps a local specialty. With a nod from the vendor, Thalrok grabbed the heavy container in his massive stone fists, took a sip, and then handed it to Bog with a grin. “It’s all yours, big boy.”

Bog’s hands shook slightly as he accepted the drink. He tipped the container back, taking a long swig. “Not too bad,” he said, surprised by the bitter yet sweet aftertaste. “A little viscous, but I’ll take it.” For the first time since arriving in Thay, Bog felt a bit more at ease, the alcohol calming his nerves.

As the two made their way through the marketplace, they couldn’t help but notice the wide berth the locals gave them. Thalrok’s towering presence drew curious glances, but it was Bog who seemed to attract the most attention. The Thayans pointed and whispered, clearly not accustomed to seeing a satyr in their midst. Bog shrugged it off, used to being an oddity wherever he went.

Meanwhile, Eirik slipped away from the group, heading down a side street to the entryway of the marketplace. He had his own business to attend to, leaving the others to explore further.

Henk, ever the charmer, approached a woman standing near one of the stalls. She introduced herself as Miranda Alathis, representing the Praetor Thark. Her demeanor was surprisingly girlish, a stark contrast to the cold and calculating atmosphere of Thay. Henk, never one to miss an opportunity, spun a tale about a distant relative and the great things he’d heard about her homeland. “But the one thing I didn’t hear,” he added with a wink, “was how beautiful the women are.”

Miranda blushed slightly, offering Henk a polite smile. “You flatter me,” she said, her voice soft. “I hope you’ll afford me your presence during the games.” Her charm was disarming, and Henk bowed deeply, scribbling his location on a piece of parchment and handing it to her. “You can visit me anytime,” he said, his eyes twinkling with mischief.

As Henk turned to leave, Bog walked by, whispering in his ear, “I bet you’ll find a picture of her aging somewhere.” The satyr’s words hinted at the possibility that Miranda’s youthful appearance might be magically enhanced. Henk sneered at the comment, half-jokingly threatening, “Get out of here before I sell you to a red wizard.”

Bog threw up his hands in mock surrender, backing away with a grin. “All right, all right,” he said, his voice light with amusement.

Corman, ever the voice of reason, stepped in. “Guys, we need to stay focused. One drink at the tavern, then we get a solid eight hours of sleep before the competition. We can’t afford to get too rowdy.”

Bog slapped Corman on the back, laughing. “Right, right. One drink.”

Henk, still basking in his successful flirtation, bowed once more to Miranda. “I’ll take my leave of you,” he said, winking as he walked away.

With their supplies gathered and the marketplace thoroughly explored, the group made their way to the Nameless Tavern. The tension of the upcoming games still hung over them, but for now, they allowed themselves a brief moment of relaxation. Tomorrow, the real challenges would begin, and they would need every ounce of strength, cunning, and teamwork to survive.

The narrow alleyway leading to the Nameless Tavern was dimly lit, and the air grew thick with a sour, yeasty stench as the group approached the decrepit building. Wedged between two larger structures, the tavern looked more like a forgotten corner of the city than a place of business. Its walls were stained and cracked, and the faint flicker of candlelight from inside did little to make it more inviting. The only sign of life, besides the occasional scuttling of tiny spiders, was the faint murmur of voices and the clink of glasses from within.

As they reached the entrance, Corman, the ever-vigilant paladin, hesitated. His brow furrowed as he took in the squalor of the place, the stench of decay and neglect hanging heavy in the air. “You can’t mean to go in here,” he said, his voice low but firm. “This place reeks of evil. It’s a trap laid by the sorcerers of Thay. I can feel it.”

Henk, the orc politician, sighed dramatically, shaking his head as if Corman’s concerns were more of an inconvenience than a genuine threat. “Corman, this isn’t evil,” Henk said, his voice tinged with exasperation. “It’s just... disgusting. But you’re right about one thing—I won’t be going in. I’m better than this place.” Without another word, Henk turned on his heel and strode away, leaving the paladin and the others to their decision.

Bog, the satyr monk, seemed unfazed by the filth and decay. He stepped up to the bar, a mischievous grin on his face. “Fine establishment you’ve got here,” he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. “Looks like it’s got plenty of history and character. What do you have in terms of beverages? Something strong, preferably.”

The barkeep, a grimy man with a permanent scowl etched into his face, introduced himself as Naren. His Common was heavily accented, but understandable. “Ruby brandy, amber wine, iced mint water, spiced tea,” he listed off, though none of it sounded particularly appealing. He also mentioned, with a shrug, that there was no food available—just drinks.

Bog waved a hand dismissively. “Dealer’s choice, something with alcohol. And maybe a few for the road. What’s your price?”

Naren didn’t bother with formalities. He sloshed several dirty glasses of what appeared to be iced tea onto the counter, each one filled with murky liquid and floating chunks of who-knew-what. The drinks were foul, but Bog was hardly picky. He grabbed one of the glasses and took a sip, grimacing slightly but not complaining.

Meanwhile, Corman remained at the door, his eyes narrowing as he watched Bog settle in at the bar. “I can’t believe you’re going in there,” he muttered, turning to Thalrok, the goliath druid. “This place is a cesspit. We shouldn’t waste our time here, especially not before the games.”

Thalrok, ever the calm and collected one, acknowledged Corman’s concerns with a nod. “You’re right, this isn’t where we should be. But I won’t leave a member of the Lord’s Alliance in here alone.” With that, Thalrok stepped into the tavern, his massive frame casting a long shadow over the dingy interior.

Not wanting to be outdone in bravery, Corman grit his teeth and followed Thalrok inside. He couldn’t let the goliath show him up, not when he had a reputation to uphold.

As they entered, the stench of mildew and fermenting alcohol hit them full force. The tavern’s only other patrons were an undead creature slumped in a corner and a feline-human hybrid sitting at the bar. The latter caught Thalrok’s attention, her black-studded leather armor and outcast demeanor standing out in the otherwise grim surroundings.

Thalrok approached her cautiously, his voice steady and respectful. “Is this your true form?” he asked, curious about the strange woman’s appearance.

The feline woman, who introduced herself as Varla, turned her sharp eyes toward him. In heavily accented Common, she confirmed that yes, this was her true form. She seemed surprised by the question but thanked him for asking nonetheless. Her tone was guarded, her words clipped, as if she was used to being judged for her appearance.

Bog, ever curious, leaned in. “What brings you to Thay, then? What’s your business here?”

Varla’s eyes narrowed slightly, and she took a slow sip of her drink before answering. “My business is my own,” she said curtly, clearly not in the mood for small talk.

Bog shrugged, unbothered by her terse response. “Fair enough,” he said, returning to his drink.

Corman, still uneasy about the whole situation, kept a watchful eye on the room. The tavern was a far cry from the noble halls he was used to, and the presence of undead only heightened his discomfort. But he wasn’t about to back down now. If Thalrok and Bog were staying, so was he.

As the group settled in, Eirik was still absent, having taken a detour to visit the proprietor of the shop where he had left his maul, *Gravebreaker*. The large birdlike proprietor had revealed to Eirik that the weapon was no ordinary maul; it had the power to break not just bones, but magical barriers, seals, and wards. However, every time Eirik used that power, it would take something from him in return—a price to be paid.

Eirik, ever hungry for power, had accepted the cost without hesitation. He had faced worse in the past, and this was just another trial to overcome. With *Gravebreaker* in hand, he made his way back to the Nameless Tavern, eager to rejoin his companions.

As Eirik approached the tavern, he could hear the faint sounds of conversation and clinking glasses from within. The stench of decay hit him as soon as he stepped into the alley, but he pressed on, pushing open the creaking door and stepping inside.

The sight that greeted him was as grim as the smell. Bog and Thalrok were seated at the bar, chatting with a strange feline woman, while Corman stood nearby, looking like he’d rather be anywhere else. Eirik smirked to himself. This was exactly the kind of place he’d expect to find his companions.

“Miss me?” Eirik asked, his voice cutting through the murmur of the tavern. He hefted *Gravebreaker* onto his shoulder, the weight of the weapon feeling more familiar and powerful than ever before.

Bog raised his glass in greeting. “Just in time for a drink, Eirik. Grab a seat.”

Eirik chuckled and made his way to the bar, the tension of the upcoming games momentarily forgotten as the group shared a brief moment of camaraderie in the dingy, forgotten tavern. Tomorrow, the real challenges would begin, but for now, they had each other—and a few questionable drinks to pass the time.

The dim light of the tavern flickered as Thalrok, the goliath druid, stood in the center of the room, his keen senses picking up on the unusual atmosphere permeating the place. The strange, repetitive motions of the undead creature at the bar, endlessly miming a drink, caught his attention first. Its low, guttural muttering of the same phrase over and over—*“I done, I done, I done…”*—sent a shiver down his spine. The eerie monotony of the scene was unsettling, but his sharp ears also picked up something else. Over the creaks of the tavern and the low hum of conversation, a series of dull thuds echoed from behind a closed door at the back of the room.

Thalrok’s curiosity was piqued. He approached Naren, the barkeep, his towering figure casting a long shadow over the grimy counter. “What’s going on in here?” Thalrok asked, his voice low and commanding. “And what’s behind that door?”

Naren’s eyes widened, a flicker of panic flashing across his face. He stammered for a moment before forcing a strained smile. “Oh, nothing, nothing at all,” he said, waving his hand dismissively. “Just a small facility back there. Probably one of my slaves has fallen over again.” He let out a nervous chuckle, clearly trying to deflect Thalrok’s attention. “Here, why don’t you try this?” Naren quickly pulled out a small barrel from beneath the counter. “A special reserve, just for someone of your stature.”

Thalrok wasn’t fooled. He took the barrel and handed it off to Bog, the satyr monk, who had been standing nearby. His eyes never left Naren. “I’d like to see what’s behind that door,” Thalrok said, his tone leaving no room for negotiation.

Naren’s smile faltered, and he glanced nervously at Varla, the mysterious feline woman seated at the bar. She met his gaze, her sharp eyes narrowing as she sized up the situation. It was clear she was calculating whether or not this was a fight she could win. The tension in the room thickened.

Sensing the rising hostility, Bog stepped forward, his usual carefree demeanor masking the seriousness of the situation. “Easy, easy,” he said, holding up his hands in a gesture of peace. “We’re just curious, that’s all. We were admiring your fine establishment and thought maybe there was some mystery behind that door.”

Varla’s eyes widened slightly, and she quickly pulled out a piece of parchment. Scribbling something hastily, she held it up to Bog. The note read: *Watch?*

Bog blinked, confused for a moment, before nodding with a grin. “Ah, I see! Yes, we’re just here to watch. Maybe even buy something, who knows?”

Naren, still uneasy, gestured toward the undead creature at the bar. “Perhaps a game?” he suggested, his voice trembling slightly. “He’s always up for a game. Maybe you’d like to join him?” He looked to Corman, the human paladin, hoping to distract the group.

Bog clapped his hands together. “A game, you say? Excellent! Corman, come join us.” He shot a glance at Thalrok, silently urging him to continue his investigation while he kept Naren occupied.

At that moment, the door to the tavern creaked open, and Eirik, the human fighter, strode in, his warhammer *Gravebreaker* resting on his shoulder. His timing was impeccable, just as Varla discreetly pushed open the door at the back of the tavern, leading Thalrok inside. With a subtle gesture, she locked the door behind them.

Inside the small room, the air was thick with tension. The dim light revealed a group of slaves huddled around the body of a Thayan soldier, barely clinging to life. His once-proud red armor was stained with blood, and his labored breaths filled the room with a sense of impending doom. A large orcish figure stood nearby, watching silently, his eyes flicking between Thalrok and Varla.

Varla turned to Thalrok, her voice low and urgent. “We have to get rid of this,” she said, gesturing to the dying soldier. “They’ll be here any minute. Do you know what to do?”

Thalrok’s eyes narrowed. “What’s in it for me?” he asked, his voice cold. He wasn’t about to risk his life without knowing what he stood to gain.

Varla’s expression hardened. “Nothing but our goodwill,” she replied. “You have to help us.”

Thalrok scoffed. “Goodwill? I don’t even know who you are.”

Varla’s frustration was palpable. She glanced back at the orcish figure, who simply shrugged, offering no help. “We were wrong to trust you,” she muttered, turning back toward the door. “Come, we’ll go back to the front.”

But Thalrok wasn’t done. He stepped forward, his eyes locked on the nearly dead soldier. The slaves surrounding the man were speaking in Thayan, their words harsh and filled with disdain. One of them kicked the soldier, who groaned weakly in response. The large orc continued to watch Thalrok, his expression unreadable.

Thalrok turned back to Varla, who had followed him into the room. “Is there anywhere nearby where I could dispose of this Thayan soldier?” he asked, his voice calm despite the gravity of the situation.

Varla shook her head. “We’ve tried everything,” she said, her voice heavy with defeat. “There are too many eyes watching. If they find out he’s here, the entire establishment will be purged. We’ll all be killed.”

Thalrok considered her words for a moment before making his decision. He raised his staff, the air around him crackling with energy, and brought it down on the soldier’s throat with a sickening thud. The man’s body convulsed once before falling still, his life snuffed out in an instant.

Varla watched in silence, her face unreadable. The orcish figure nodded in approval, while the slaves looked on, their expressions a mix of relief and fear.

“Do as you will,” Varla said quietly, her voice barely above a whisper.

Thalrok wiped the blood from his staff and turned back toward the door. The deed was done, but the consequences of his actions were yet to be seen.

The tension in the Nameless Tavern escalated quickly after Thalrok, the goliath druid, dealt a decisive blow to the throat of the dying Thayan soldier. His staff struck with precision, crushing the man’s windpipe, and the soldier’s body crumpled lifelessly to the ground. The slaves who had been tormenting the man recoiled in horror, their eyes wide as they hastily began stripping the body of valuables, all while rolling it up in a blanket. The atmosphere in the back room was thick with fear and desperation, and Thalrok could feel the weight of his actions settling in.

Varla, the feline woman who had been aiding Thalrok, muttered a quiet curse under her breath. “Oh no,” she whispered, her sharp ears picking up the sound of approaching footsteps from the front of the tavern. Thalrok tensed, realizing that they were not alone.

In the main room of the tavern, the rest of the group—Corman, Eirik, and Bog—found themselves face to face with three figures who had just entered. Two Thayan soldiers flanked an inquisitor, their red armor gleaming in the dim light. The inquisitor, his eyes cold and calculating, scanned the room as if he were a predator assessing his prey. He sneered as his gaze landed on the group, his voice dripping with disdain. “So, the representatives of the Lord’s Alliance have found themselves in a place becoming of their status,” he said, his tone mocking as he gestured toward Bog. “Weren’t you meant to be confined to the Pit of Endless Servitude?”

Bog, ever the satyr with a quick retort, raised his glass lazily and took a long sip. “Not yet,” he replied, his voice casual, as though he were addressing an old friend. His nonchalance only seemed to irritate the inquisitor further.

Eirik, sensing the tension, stood from his stool, the legs scraping loudly against the floor as he pushed it back. He sized up the inquisitor, his warhammer *Gravebreaker* resting on his shoulder. “Inquisitor Medes told us we’d be allowed to partake here,” Eirik said, his voice steady but firm.

The inquisitor’s lips curled into a cruel smile. He raised his hand, and a faint blue light flickered around his fingers. “Medes reports no such thing,” he said coldly, his eyes narrowing as he cast *Detect Thoughts* on Eirik. The fighter felt the inquisitor’s presence in his mind, but he made no attempt to resist. He had nothing to hide, and he met the inquisitor’s gaze with calm indifference.

As the inquisitor sifted through Eirik’s thoughts, one of the Thayan soldiers stepped toward Corman, the paladin, and began posturing aggressively. Corman, ever the devout follower of Lathander, immediately began reciting his favorite prayer in his mind, hoping to shield himself from whatever foul sorcery the inquisitor might attempt. *Lathander protect me, Lathander protect me,* he repeated silently, his mind focused on his god.

The inquisitor, however, seemed amused by Corman’s mental defenses. He chuckled darkly, as though he could still sense the paladin’s thoughts despite the prayers. “Feats of strength,” he muttered, mocking the paladin’s pious attempts at resistance.

After a few tense moments, the inquisitor turned his attention to the barkeep, Naren. “Let us not see this again,” the inquisitor commanded, his voice sharp. “You will no longer welcome these in your establishment, including this beast.” He gestured dismissively toward Bog, clearly referring to the satyr. With a final glance at the group, the inquisitor and his soldiers turned and left the tavern, their heavy footsteps echoing as they disappeared into the night.

Bog, never one to let an insult slide, made a crude hand gesture toward the inquisitor’s retreating back, his fist clenched in defiance. Corman, meanwhile, let out a sigh of relief, though his tension remained palpable. The situation had been diffused, but the danger was far from over.

Back in the hidden room, Varla was growing increasingly panicked. She handed Thalrok a small bag of dust, her hands trembling. “This is used by our people in times of hiding,” she explained hurriedly. “It will make you invisible, but you must leave now. If the body is found here, we’re all dead.” Her voice cracked with fear, and Thalrok could tell that time was running out.

Thalrok took the dust and nodded. “I’ll take care of the body,” he said calmly. “But tell me, what is this letter I found in the latrine?” He held up the soiled parchment he had discovered earlier, the foul stench still clinging to it.

Varla shook her head, her panic rising. “I don’t know,” she admitted, her voice strained. “We don’t have time for this. They’re onto us.”

With no further answers to be had, Thalrok decided to act. He sprinkled the dust into the air, and within moments, his form shimmered and disappeared from sight. The invisibility would only last a few minutes, but it was enough. He grabbed the body of the Thayan soldier, now wrapped in a blanket, and slipped out of the back room, moving swiftly and silently through the alleyways of Thay.

Once outside, Thalrok knew he had to dispose of the body quickly. He considered his options and decided that the nearby ocean would be the best place to hide the evidence. With a deep breath, he called upon his druidic powers and shifted into the form of a hornet, his body shrinking and sprouting wings. The transformation complete, he grasped the body in his insectoid limbs and took to the sky, flying swiftly toward the ocean.

The flight was brief, and within minutes, Thalrok reached the water’s edge. He dropped the body into the waves, watching as it sank beneath the surface and disappeared into the depths. Satisfied that the evidence was gone, Thalrok turned and flew back toward the city, his mind already racing with thoughts of what was to come.

Back at the tavern, the rest of the group had settled into an uneasy calm. Eirik, Corman, and Bog sat in silence, each of them contemplating the events of the night. Thalrok would return soon, but the danger was far from over. The Thayan inquisitors were watching, and the games were only just beginning.

As the group prepared for what lay ahead, they knew one thing for certain: they would need to rely on each other more than ever if they were to survive the trials of Thay.

As dusk settled over the city of Thay, the adventurers found themselves at a crossroads. Thalrok, the goliath druid, had just returned from a covert mission—disposing of a Thayan soldier’s body in the deep, swirling waters beyond the city. His transformation into a giant hornet had allowed him to complete the task swiftly, but the weight of his actions lingered as he rejoined his companions outside the Nameless Tavern. They had narrowly escaped the watchful eyes of the Thayan inquisitors, but the night was far from over.

Bog, the satyr monk, lingered behind briefly to thank Naren, the barkeep, for his service, slipping him a few coins as a gesture of goodwill. Naren, however, stiffened at the sight of the gold, shaking his head in refusal. "By order of the Probity Corps, I cannot accept this," he muttered, his eyes darting nervously toward the door as if expecting the inquisitors to return at any moment. With a subtle nod, he urged Bog to leave, his expression one of quiet desperation. Bog, ever the pragmatist, scooped up the drinks he had ordered, including a cask of reserve, and made his way outside to join the others.

As the group reconvened, the cool night air did little to ease the tension that had been building. Corman, the human paladin, was the first to speak, his voice firm with conviction. "We need to pursue the signal that was sent to us earlier," he declared. "We haven't met the rest of the Lord's Alliance representatives, and they may be in danger. It's our duty to help them."

Henk, the orc politician, was less concerned with the signal and more focused on his own agenda. He had spent the evening mingling with the Thayan elite, building a reputation for their team, but now he had other plans. "I’ve got a meeting tonight," he said with a sly grin, referring to a rendezvous with a mysterious woman known as the Fair Maiden. "I’ll be... occupied for the rest of the night."

Corman frowned, clearly frustrated by Henk’s lack of seriousness. "We need you to be locked in, Henk," he pleaded. "The games start tomorrow, and we can’t afford any distractions. We need to win."

Henk’s grin only widened. "Oh, I’ll be locked in, alright. Real deep, real tight," he replied, his tone dripping with innuendo. Corman’s expression darkened, his disappointment palpable. He had long since grown weary of Henk’s antics, and the orc’s flippant attitude did little to inspire confidence.

Eirik, the human fighter, stepped forward, his focus already on the upcoming single combat tournament. "A good night’s rest before the games is the proper course," he said, his voice steady. "We can investigate the signal after the games. We need to be at our best."

But Corman wasn’t convinced. "I won’t be able to sleep knowing there are good people in danger," he argued. "If I have to, I’ll go check it out myself."

Eirik sighed, clearly exasperated. "Do what you will, but I’ll be resting. I’ll carry the team tomorrow, while you play your little games." With that, he turned on his heel and began making his way back to the Pit of Eternal Servitude, the grim lodging where they had been staying.

Thalrok, ever the voice of reason, placed a hand on Corman’s shoulder. "Looks like it’s just you and me," he said, his deep voice rumbling with quiet strength. He glanced over at Bog, who had been uncharacteristically quiet. "You coming with us, Bog?"

Bog, still slightly buzzed from the drinks he had consumed, gave a lazy nod. "Yeah, I’m in."

As the group prepared to set off, Eirik suddenly tensed, his sharp instincts kicking in. Something wasn’t right. He couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being watched. His eyes scanned the shadows, and though he couldn’t see anyone, the sensation of being followed was unmistakable.

Grabbing Corman’s arm, Eirik subtly gestured toward Thalrok. "Perhaps our druid should scout ahead," he suggested, his voice low. "He has the skills for it. We need to know if we’re being followed."

Corman blinked, clearly confused. "What are you talking about?" he asked, his brow furrowed.

Thalrok, however, understood Eirik’s meaning immediately. "You think someone’s tailing us?" he asked, his voice calm but serious.

Eirik nodded. "I’m not sure who, but we can’t afford to be careless. Scout ahead, see what you find. But don’t engage—just report back."

Thalrok considered the request for a moment before nodding. "I’ll take a look around," he said. With a deep breath, he called upon his druidic powers once more, his form shifting into that of a small, stealthy creature—a mouse, quick and silent. He scurried off into the shadows, his keen senses attuned to any signs of danger.

The rest of the group waited in tense silence, their eyes darting nervously around the dimly lit streets. Corman’s hand rested on the hilt of his sword, ready to defend his companions if necessary. Bog, meanwhile, leaned casually against a wall, his expression unreadable as he sipped from his flask.

After several minutes, Thalrok returned, his form shifting back into that of a goliath as he approached the group. "We’re definitely being followed," he reported, his voice low. "But it’s not the Probity Corps. Whoever it is, they’re good at staying hidden."

Eirik’s jaw tightened. "We need to be careful," he said. "Let’s move quickly and quietly. We can’t afford to draw attention before the games."

With that, the group set off, their footsteps soft against the cobblestone streets. The signal from the Lord’s Alliance still beckoned, but now they had another threat to contend with—an unseen enemy lurking in the shadows, watching their every move.

As the group stood huddled in the shadowy alleyway, the tension in the air was palpable. Thalrok, the goliath druid, had just returned from his scouting mission, his massive frame moving with surprising stealth as he approached his companions. "We’re being followed," he said quietly, his deep voice rumbling like distant thunder. "A cloaked figure, flanked by avian creatures. I saw them at the opening ceremonies. They’re keeping their distance, but they’ll converge on us a few blocks ahead."

Eirik, the battle-hardened fighter, narrowed his eyes, gripping the handle of *Gravebreaker* tightly. "Thay’s greatness is just a facade, propped up by fear and intimidation. We should confront them," he growled, his voice filled with disdain for the land they found themselves in.

Bog, the satyr monk, nodded in agreement. "If we confront them, we do it together. We’re out of our element here, and we can’t afford to be divided."

Henk, the orc politician, who had been idly adjusting his cloak, glanced at Thalrok. "Lead the way, big guy," he said with a grin. "Let’s see what they want."

Thalrok gave a curt nod. "On me, boys," he said, his voice steady. With that, the group moved cautiously down the narrow street, their footsteps muffled by the night.

As they rounded a corner, they came face to face with the cloaked figure. Flanked by two ferocious avian creatures, the figure stood at the far end of the street, surrounded by a few Thayan civilians and their undead servants. The figure raised a hand, signaling the creatures to stop, and for a moment, there was a tense silence. The street, though not empty, seemed to hold its breath as the two groups faced off.

Henk, never one to shy away from confrontation, stepped forward with a booming voice. "Thay, Thay, Thay!" he bellowed, his voice echoing down the street. "Why are we being followed? Speak now, or face the consequences!" His words were laced with intimidation, but the cloaked figure remained unmoved.

Without a word, the figure gestured to the side, and from the shadows emerged a massive creature wielding a sledgehammer. Its hulking form stomped forward, the ground trembling beneath its feet. The creature pointed a finger at Henk, then at the group, as if issuing a silent challenge.

Before anyone could react, the cloaked figure and its minions sprang into action. The battle had begun.

"Gods damn it," Bog muttered under his breath, drawing his weapons as the chaos erupted around them.

Thalrok, caught off guard by the sudden aggression, moved quickly, but his initiative was sluggish. "I’ll make up for it," he growled, readying himself for the fight. Eirik, ever alert, swapped his initiative with Thalrok, taking the lead as the battle unfolded.

Henk, thinking quickly, muttered an incantation under his breath, casting *Silence* over the enemies. The air around the cloaked figure and its avian creatures became eerily still, the sounds of the city vanishing as the spell took hold. Henk then bolstered Bog with a quick word of inspiration, before ducking out of the way, narrowly avoiding a jab from the cloaked figure’s short sword.

One of the avian creatures, unaffected by the silence, took to the air, landing on the side of a nearby building. From its perch, it hurled two jets of fire toward Thalrok. One struck his stone-like skin, leaving a charred mark, while the other missed, sizzling harmlessly into the ground.

Meanwhile, the cloaked figure, moving with unnatural speed, darted out of the silenced area and launched a flurry of attacks at Eirik. A dagger flashed in the dim light, but Eirik was ready. As the blade came toward him, he muttered a quick spell, casting *Shield* to deflect the blow. The magical barrier shimmered around him, absorbing the impact and preventing what could have been a grievous wound.

The figure hissed in frustration, its movements quick and feral. It lashed out with a bite, but Eirik, bolstered by his shield, stood his ground. "You’ll have to do better than that," he snarled, his warhammer ready to strike.

As the battle raged on, Bog took a moment to center himself, using his uncanny metabolism to recover some of his focus and strength. He felt the energy surge through his body, revitalizing him for the fight ahead. With a grin, he charged forward, ready to unleash a flurry of strikes on the nearest enemy.

Henk, still maintaining concentration on the *Silence* spell, repositioned himself, staying out of harm’s way while continuing to support his companions. His eyes darted between the enemies, calculating his next move.

Thalrok, now fully engaged in the battle, called upon the power of nature. His skin hardened like stone, and he prepared to unleash the full force of his druidic magic on the enemies before him. The avian creatures, still perched on the building, would soon learn the wrath of the storm.

Eirik, now fully in the fray, hefted *Gravebreaker* with both hands. The warhammer, imbued with ancient magic, pulsed with energy as he swung it toward the cloaked figure. The impact sent a shockwave through the air, but the figure dodged nimbly, its movements inhumanly fast.

The battle was far from over, but the adventurers stood united, their resolve unshaken. They had faced countless dangers before, and though Thay was a land of treachery and deceit, they would not be cowed. Together, they would confront whatever enemies lay in their path, and they would emerge victorious—or die trying.

The alleyway was filled with tension as the group prepared for the oncoming assault. The cloaked figure, flanked by avian creatures, had finally revealed its hostile intent, and the battle was now in full swing. Corman, the human paladin, was the first to act. Whispering a prayer to Lathander, his god, he invoked Divine Strike, his longsword glowing with holy light. With a swift motion, he slashed at the cloaked figure, the blade cutting through the air with a righteous fury. The figure, despite its agility, couldn’t fully evade the strike, and Corman’s sword found its mark.

"Thay, Thay, Thay," Corman muttered under his breath, almost like a mantra, as he tapped into his Lay on Hands ability, restoring his health with a surge of divine energy. His wounds closed, and he stood tall, ready for more. Eirik, ever the strategist, reminded him, “Paladins get an extra attack, you know.” Corman’s eyes lit up with that realization, and he swung his longsword again, the blade slicing through the air toward the cloaked figure, who barely dodged the second strike.

Bog, the satyr monk, was quick to follow Corman’s lead. With a grin, he dashed forward, his fists a blur as he unleashed a flurry of blows on the cloaked figure. His strikes were relentless, each one landing with precision. On the final punch, Bog twisted behind the figure, locking it into a reverse chokehold. The figure struggled, but Bog’s grip was ironclad, holding the enemy in place, facing Eirik and Corman.

As Bog grappled the cloaked figure, one of the avian creatures, perched on a nearby rooftop, screeched and launched itself at him, claws outstretched. The creature’s talons raked across Bog’s back, but the satyr gritted his teeth and held his ground. He was tempted to deflect the attack back at the creature, but he had already spent his reaction. Bog cursed under his breath, but his focus remained on maintaining the grapple.

Meanwhile, another avian creature took to the air, joining its companion on the rooftop. From its elevated position, it began hurling jets of flame down toward Thalrok, the goliath druid. One of the fireballs struck him, searing his stone-like skin, while the other missed, fizzling harmlessly against the cobblestones. Henk, the orc politician, saw the incoming danger and shouted a warning. "Thalrok, watch out!"

The massive ogre-like creature that had emerged from the shadows now lumbered forward, its eyes locked on Corman. With a roar, it swung its massive maul in a wide arc, aiming for the paladin. Corman, however, was ready. With a display of freakish athleticism, he dodged the blow, bending backward in a near-impossible maneuver that left the ogre’s maul swinging through empty air. 

Thalrok, who had been momentarily distracted by the chaos, attempted to cast *Snare* on the ogre, hoping to restrain the beast. But the spell fizzled as the creature shrugged off the magical trap, its sheer brute strength too much for the druid’s magic to contain. Realizing the danger he was in, Thalrok decided it was time to change tactics. With a deep breath, he called upon his druidic powers and transformed into a massive hornet, his body twisting and morphing until he filled the air like a living war machine.

The transformation was swift, and Thalrok took to the air, buzzing loudly as he hovered above the battlefield. His new form was intimidating, his wings beating rapidly as he prepared to strike from above. The ogre, seeing its prey take flight, swung its fist in a desperate attempt to swat the druid from the sky, but Thalrok was already out of reach, his hornet form agile and swift.

Eirik, standing near Corman, saw the opportunity to strike. With *Gravebreaker* in hand, he charged at the cloaked figure, now held in Bog’s chokehold. The warhammer hummed with magical energy as Eirik brought it down in a powerful arc. The cloaked figure, still struggling against Bog’s grip, managed to twist just enough to avoid a direct hit, but the force of the blow still sent a shockwave through the air.

The cloaked figure hissed in frustration, its movements becoming more erratic. It lashed out with a dagger, aiming for Eirik, but the fighter was ready. With a quick incantation, he cast *Shield*, a shimmering barrier of magical energy forming around him. The dagger glanced off the shield, leaving Eirik unharmed. The figure, now desperate, attempted to bite at him, but once again, Eirik’s defenses held strong.

As the battle raged on, the Thayan civilians and their undead servants who had been watching from the sidelines began to back away, clearly unnerved by the chaos unfolding before them. The Thayan soldiers, who had initially been observing the fight, also began to retreat, unwilling to get caught in the melee.

Thalrok, now hovering above the battlefield in his hornet form, surveyed the scene. The avian creatures were still perched on the rooftops, raining fire down on his companions, but he had a plan. With a loud buzz, he swooped toward the nearest creature, his stinger poised to strike.

Bog, still holding the cloaked figure in a chokehold, tightened his grip, his muscles straining as he attempted to subdue the enemy. "You’re not going anywhere," he growled, his voice low and dangerous.

Meanwhile, Corman, his health fully restored and his faith in Lathander unwavering, prepared for another strike. His longsword gleamed in the dim light as he readied himself to deliver justice to the enemies of the Lord’s Alliance.

The battle was far from over, but the adventurers stood united, their resolve unshaken. Each of them played their part, their skills and abilities complementing one another as they fought against the mysterious cloaked figure and its minions. They had faced countless dangers before, and though Thay was a land of treachery and deceit, they would not be cowed. Together, they would confront whatever enemies lay in their path, and they would emerge victorious—or die trying.

The battle in the narrow alleyway had erupted into chaos, with the adventurers locked in combat against a mysterious cloaked figure and its minions—avian creatures and a hulking ogre-like brute. Thalrok, now in his massive hornet form, hovered high above the fray, watching the scene unfold from a vantage point 70 feet in the air. His wings buzzed loudly as he prepared to dive back into the fight, but for now, he was out of reach of the melee below.

Corman, the paladin of Lathander, stood resolute on the ground, his glowing longsword in hand. His eyes darted toward Thalrok, and in a moment of frustration, he yelled, “Our druid abandons us!” The sight of the goliath soaring above the battlefield left him feeling exposed, but he quickly refocused. There was no time to dwell on it—he had enemies to slay.

Eirik, the ever-focused fighter, had his gaze locked on the cloaked figure, who was now grappled by Bog, the satyr monk. With *Gravebreaker* in hand, Eirik swung at the figure, but the first strike missed. Undeterred, he followed up with a second swing, aiming to topple the enemy prone. However, the figure’s agility allowed it to narrowly avoid being knocked down, though it remained trapped in Bog’s iron grip.

Meanwhile, one of the avian creatures perched on a nearby rooftop cast a jet of fire toward the group. The flames shot out in a brilliant burst, engulfing Eirik, Corman, and Henk. The searing heat singed their skin, but the adventurers pressed on, their resolve unshaken. Henk, quick to react, sidestepped the flames and dropped his *Bloodfire Ballista* onto the ground, readying it for his next move. He turned toward Eirik, shouting words of encouragement. “Harness the power of the cosmos! You are limitless!” His voice carried over the din of battle, bolstering his companion with *Bardic Inspiration*.

Thalrok, still hovering in the air, watched as another of the avian creatures took aim at him, launching fireballs into the sky. The fiery projectiles streaked toward him, and though Thalrok was nimble in his hornet form, two of the fireballs struck true, exploding in a magnificent display of flames. The impact sent ripples of heat across the battlefield, but the goliath-turned-hornet remained aloft, albeit singed.

Below, the cloaked figure, still trapped in Bog’s chokehold, struggled to break free. With a burst of strength, it managed to slip out of the satyr’s grip, but it couldn’t escape the battle entirely. Instead of fleeing, the figure unleashed a foul stench, a nauseating aura that filled the immediate area. The adventurers recoiled as the putrid smell washed over them, and Bog, caught in the thick of it, found himself poisoned, his movements sluggish and his strikes less precise.

Corman, ever the stalwart paladin, was undeterred by the stench. He raised his longsword high, calling upon the divine power of Lathander. “Lathander, pass me your holy strength!” he bellowed, his voice filled with righteous fury. With a mighty swing, he struck at the cloaked figure, and as his blade connected, a burst of radiant energy exploded outward. The figure, already weakened from the battle, was consumed by the holy light, its form disintegrating in a brilliant flash. The cloaked figure was no more, its body reduced to ash by the power of Corman’s Divine Smite.

With the immediate threat of the cloaked figure gone, Corman took a moment to heal himself, using the last of his *Lay on Hands* ability to restore his strength. The battle was far from over, and he would need every ounce of power to face what was still to come.

Bog, though reeling from the effects of the poison, wasn’t about to back down. Gritting his teeth, he charged toward one of the remaining avian creatures. His fists flew in a flurry of blows, each strike landing with precision. “Flurry of Blows!” he shouted, his fists a blur as he pummeled the creature. With a final strike, he attempted to grapple the creature, but it slipped away, evading his grasp. Undeterred, Bog disengaged, using his monk’s agility to retreat a few steps, readying himself for the next round of attacks.

As the battle continued, the massive ogre-like brute turned its attention back to Corman. With a roar, it raised its maul high and brought it down in a reckless swing. Corman, despite his earlier triumph, couldn’t avoid the blow. The impact sent him sprawling to the ground, the force of the strike knocking him prone. The brute, seeing its opportunity, followed up with a crushing fist, slamming it down on the paladin’s prone form. Corman gasped as the air was knocked from his lungs, but he wasn’t out of the fight yet.

High above, Thalrok watched the scene unfold, his keen eyes taking in the battlefield. The avian creatures were still raining fire down on his companions, and the brute was wreaking havoc on the ground. It was time to act. With a loud buzz, Thalrok dove toward the nearest avian creature, his stinger poised to strike. The battle was far from over, but the adventurers fought on, their determination and teamwork keeping them in the fight.

The streets of Thay were filled with the sounds of clashing steel, roaring flames, and the battle cries of the adventurers. Though they were outnumbered and outmatched, they fought with everything they had, knowing that failure was not an option. Together, they would face whatever challenges lay ahead, and they would emerge victorious—or die trying.

The battle raged on in the narrow alleyway, with the adventurers locked in combat against the mysterious cloaked figure and its minions. Corman, the paladin of Lathander, had just been crushed under the massive blow of the ogre-like brute, his body crumpling to the ground as pain surged through him. His companions fought desperately to keep the tide of battle from overwhelming them, each pushing their limits in the face of overwhelming odds.

High above the fray, Thalrok, the goliath druid, hovered in his hornet form, wings buzzing as he surveyed the battlefield. Fireballs had seared his insect-like body, but he remained airborne, determined to contribute to the fight. He called down to his companions, “I’ll never leave you, brothers!” With a screeching dive, he plummeted toward one of the avian creatures perched on a nearby wall. His stinger struck true, piercing the creature’s body and dealing a devastating blow. The phoenixborn, as the creatures were known, erupted in a fiery explosion upon its death, but Thalrok skillfully veered away just in time, avoiding the worst of the blast.

Meanwhile, Bog, the satyr monk, had managed to grapple the cloaked figure, locking it into a reverse chokehold. His muscles strained as he held the figure in place, allowing Eirik, the human fighter, to step in with his mighty warhammer, *Gravebreaker*. Eirik swung once, but the figure, despite being restrained, twisted just enough to avoid the blow. Undeterred, Eirik followed up with another strike, this time aiming to knock the figure prone. However, the figure’s agility allowed it to remain on its feet, though still trapped in Bog’s grip.

The battle was far from easy. One of the avian creatures perched on the rooftop above launched a jet of fire down toward the group, engulfing Eirik, Corman, and Henk in flames. The searing heat singed their skin, but they pressed on. Henk, ever the opportunist, sidestepped the flames and dropped his *Bloodfire Ballista* onto the ground, ready to unleash its devastating power. “Harness the power of the cosmos! You are limitless!” Henk shouted to Eirik, casting *Bardic Inspiration* to bolster his companion.

Corman, still reeling from the ogre’s strike, struggled to his feet. He felt the divine power of Lathander flowing through him, healing his wounds and restoring his strength. “Lathander, pass me your holy strength!” he bellowed, his longsword glowing with radiant energy. With a mighty swing, he brought his blade down on the cloaked figure, and as it connected, a burst of divine light erupted from the sword. The figure let out a hiss of pain as its form was consumed by the holy energy, disintegrating into ash. The cloaked figure was no more.

But the battle was far from over. One of the remaining phoenixborn launched another fireball at Thalrok, who was still flying above the battlefield. The flames struck the druid, but he remained aloft, albeit singed. Below, the massive ogre-like brute roared in fury as it swung its maul in a reckless arc toward Corman. The paladin, despite his earlier triumph, couldn’t avoid the blow. The force of the strike sent him sprawling to the ground once more, the wind knocked from his lungs.

Bog, still grappling with the effects of the cloaked figure’s poisonous stench, took a moment to center himself. His strikes had been less precise, but he wasn’t about to let that stop him. With a flurry of blows, he charged toward one of the remaining avian creatures, his fists flying in a blur of motion. Each strike landed with precision, but the creature managed to evade his final grapple. Frustrated but undeterred, Bog disengaged, using his monk’s agility to retreat a few steps and prepare for the next assault.

Eirik, seeing Corman knocked to the ground once more, stepped over the fallen paladin and turned his attention to the ogre. With *Gravebreaker* in hand, he swung with all his might, aiming to topple the brute. The warhammer connected with a sickening crunch, and the ogre staggered before collapsing to the ground, its massive form crashing into the cobblestones. With a triumphant roar, Eirik followed up with another strike, caving in part of the creature’s chest. Oddly, no blood spilled from the wound—its insides were dry and lifeless.

“Get up, Corman!” Eirik shouted as he stood over the fallen paladin. “We must finish this!” His voice was filled with urgency, knowing that the battle was still far from over. Corman, barely conscious and hyperventilating from the pain, struggled to push himself up, his body battered and bruised.

As the battle continued, Henk, lying prone like a soldier from a bygone era, aimed his *Bloodfire Ballista* at one of the remaining phoenixborn. He unleashed a bolt of fiery energy, but in the confusion of the battle, his aim faltered, and the shot went wide. “Damn it!” he cursed, adjusting his aim for another attempt.

Thalrok, still in his hornet form, watched from above as the battle unfolded. The adventurers were holding their own, but the fight was far from won. With a loud buzz, he dove toward the remaining phoenixborn, his stinger poised to strike. The adventurers fought on, their determination and teamwork keeping them in the fight.

The streets of Thay echoed with the sounds of battle—clashing steel, roaring flames, and the cries of the adventurers as they fought for their lives. Though outnumbered and outmatched, they pressed on, knowing that failure was not an option. Together, they would face whatever challenges lay ahead, and they would emerge victorious—or die trying.

The battle in the narrow alleyway was reaching its crescendo, with the adventurers locked in a desperate struggle against the cloaked figure and its minions. The air was thick with the smell of charred stone and the sound of clashing steel, punctuated by the occasional screech of the phoenixborn creatures perched on the rooftops, hurling fire at the heroes below.

Henk, ever the resourceful orc politician, had set up his *Bloodfire Ballista*, its magical bolts crackling with energy as they flew toward the phoenixborn. His first shot, however, went wide, the bolt disappearing into the night. Frustrated but undeterred, Henk turned to Corman, the paladin of Lathander, who had been knocked down by the ogre-like brute. "You are not defeated!" Henk called out, his voice filled with encouragement. "Stand with fury!"

Corman, still dazed from the brutal hit, closed his eyes for a moment, finding a brief moment of calm amidst the chaos. With a grunt, he performed a quick kick-up, using only five feet of movement to spring back onto his feet. His longsword gleamed in the dim light as he raised it high above his head. "By the power of Lathander!" he shouted, his voice booming through the alley. He swung down with righteous fury, his blade crackling with divine energy as it connected with the prone ogre. The holy light from his *Divine Smite* erupted from the blade, sending a shockwave through the creature’s body. The ogre let out a guttural roar, but it was clear that the paladin’s strike had cut deep.

Next to him, Bog, the satyr monk, smirked at Corman’s display of swordsmanship. "You don’t need swords," he muttered, his fists clenched as he prepared to unleash another flurry of blows. Bog charged forward, aiming his strikes at the ogre’s exposed chest cavity, where Eirik’s warhammer had already created a gaping wound. His fists flew in rapid succession, but the ogre’s thick, leathery skin absorbed most of the impact. Frustrated, Bog disengaged, his movements fluid as he darted back to a safer position. "I prefer my enemies standing, but I’ll keep going," he quipped, casting a glance at Corman.

The ogre, sensing the tide of battle turning against it, began to stagger backward, its massive maul dragging along the ground. It cast a glance toward the alleyway it had emerged from, as if contemplating retreat. But before it could make its escape, the sky above darkened as Thalrok, still in his hornet form, swooped down from the rooftops. The goliath druid flipped in mid-air, performing a daring 180-degree dive to avoid any anti-air spells, and then struck the ogre with a vicious bite. The creature let out a final, pitiful roar before its body collapsed, disintegrating into dust under the force of Thalrok’s attack.

As Thalrok ascended back into the sky, his wings buzzing loudly, he spotted the remaining phoenixborn perched on the wall. With a quick burst of speed, he flew toward it, his stinger poised for another strike. The phoenixborn let out a screech as Thalrok’s stinger pierced its body, and like its companion before it, the creature exploded in a fiery burst. Thalrok managed to pull away just in time, though the heat from the explosion scorched his wings.

On the ground, Eirik, ever the pragmatic fighter, turned his attention to the last remaining phoenixborn—a phoenixborn woman who had been hurling jets of flame at the group. "Can you survive the blast?" Eirik asked Corman, his voice calm but urgent. He wanted to know if he needed to drag the paladin away before delivering the final blow.

Corman, still standing tall despite the punishment he had taken, gave a confident nod. "Lathander has always protected me," he declared. "I’m confident He will again."

From the other side of the battlefield, Bog called out, "That’s a no!" His voice carried a hint of sarcasm, but there was concern behind it as well.

Eirik, trusting in Corman’s faith, swung *Gravebreaker* at the phoenixborn woman. The warhammer connected with a sickening crunch, and the force of the blow sent her sprawling to the ground. She was prone now, vulnerable. Without hesitation, Eirik brought *Gravebreaker* down again, aiming for a killing blow. The hammer struck true, but the phoenixborn, despite her injuries, managed to survive the hit. Her body crackled with energy as she struggled to stand, clearly preparing for one final act of defiance.

The phoenixborn staggered to her feet, using all her remaining strength to hurl another jet of flame at the adventurers. The fire shot out in a brilliant burst, aimed directly at Corman and Eirik. Corman, trying to predict the trajectory of the flames, attempted to dodge, but instead, he dove directly into the path of the fire. The flames engulfed him, and he let out a cry of pain as the heat seared his flesh.

Eirik, seeing his companion fall, gritted his teeth. "Lathander, protect him," he muttered under his breath. With a final swing of *Gravebreaker*, he brought the warhammer down on the phoenixborn woman, her body crumpling under the force of the blow. The battle was over.

The alleyway fell silent, save for the crackling of the dying flames. The cloaked figure and its minions had been defeated, but the cost had been high. Corman lay on the ground, his body battered and burned, but still alive. Thalrok descended from the sky, shifting back into his goliath form as he landed next to his companions. Bog, ever the joker, gave a mock salute. "Well, that was fun," he said, though there was a hint of weariness in his voice.

Eirik knelt next to Corman, placing a hand on the paladin’s shoulder. "You did well, Corman," he said quietly. "Lathander truly watches over you."

Corman, though barely conscious, managed a weak smile. "Victory nears," he whispered, his faith in Lathander unshaken despite the pain.

As the group gathered themselves, the realization set in: this was only the beginning. The Thayan Games were still ahead, and the dangers they had faced tonight were but a taste of what was to come. But for now, they had survived. Together, they would face whatever challenges lay ahead, united in their resolve to emerge victorious—or die trying.

The alleyway was a battlefield littered with ash, dust, and the remnants of a fierce ambush. The adventurers—Corman, Eirik, Henk, Bog, and Thalrok—stood amidst the wreckage of their enemies, their bodies battered but their spirits unbroken. The last of the phoenixborn had been felled by Eirik’s mighty *Gravebreaker*, its fiery explosion searing the air around them. Corman, the paladin of Lathander, lay motionless on the ground, his body a smoldering heap, barely clinging to life after the brutal assault.

Henk, ever the opportunist, had taken his position behind his *Bloodfire Ballista*, firing a shot reminiscent of Tank from *The Matrix*, as he lined up his aim on the fleeing phoenixborn. One bolt of lightning struck true, piercing the creature’s side, while the other went wide, hitting a nearby barrel with a crackling burst of energy. The phoenixborn let out a screech of pain, its wings faltering as it attempted to escape. But it was too late.

Bog, the satyr monk, saw his chance. With a powerful leap, he bounded over the flames that still flickered in the aftermath of the battle, landing gracefully beside Corman’s prone form. He knelt down, his hands steady as he worked to stabilize his fallen comrade. The air was thick with tension as Bog muttered a quick prayer to whatever gods might be listening. His hands moved with surprising skill, and within moments, he had managed to stabilize Corman, bringing him back from the brink of death. The paladin’s breathing steadied, though he remained unconscious, his body too battered to rise on its own.

Thalrok, still in his hornet form, hovered above the battlefield, his wings buzzing as he surveyed the scene. The last phoenixborn was attempting to flee, its fiery wings beating rapidly as it tried to escape the adventurers’ wrath. But Thalrok was not about to let it go. With a swift dive, he swooped down, his stinger poised to strike. The phoenixborn let out one final screech as Thalrok’s stinger pierced its body, and in a fiery explosion, the creature disintegrated into ash, leaving behind only a faint trail of smoke.

Eirik, ever the pragmatist, stepped forward to assess the situation. His warhammer, *Gravebreaker*, still hummed with the remnants of the battle’s energy as he knelt beside the body of the ogre-like brute they had faced. His brow furrowed as he ran his hands through the creature’s desiccated remains. The beast’s insides were dry, like paper mache, and as Eirik sifted through the dust, he couldn’t help but mutter, “Is this what passes for strength here? Undead and slaves? I’m not impressed.”

Henk, meanwhile, had turned his attention to the mysterious figure they had first noticed following them. He knelt beside the body, peeling back the mask that covered the figure’s face. What he found beneath was not a man, but some form of undead—a decayed corpse, its flesh rotting and half its jaw missing. “No wonder it wore a mask,” Henk muttered, his voice laced with disgust. He rifled through the figure’s pockets, hoping to find some clue as to why they had been targeted, but there was little of value—only a short sword and a light crossbow, the tools of a common assassin.

As the group gathered themselves, Thalrok shifted back into his goliath form, his massive frame towering over the others. He approached Corman, who had been helped to his feet by Eirik, and placed a hand on the paladin’s shoulder. “I’ve got you, brother,” Thalrok said, his voice deep and steady. “Even though you doubted me in this fight, we may have another soon.” With a wave of his hand, Thalrok called upon the power of nature, channeling healing energy into Corman’s battered body. The paladin let out a sigh of relief as the soothing energy flowed through him, restoring some of his strength.

Corman, still wide-eyed and shaken from the battle, nodded in gratitude. “The forces of evil seek false advantage at every turn,” he muttered, his voice weak but resolute. “This will only empower me to be stronger for the games.” He leaned heavily on Thalrok, his legs barely able to support his weight. “Let’s get back. I’m... not in the best shape.”

Eirik, ever the leader, stepped forward, his eyes scanning the wreckage one last time. “Shall we rest?” he asked, his voice calm but firm. He reached down and picked up the skull mask that had covered the face of the undead assassin. “I’ll take this,” he said, tucking it into his pack. “A reminder of what we’re up against.”

The group nodded in agreement, their bodies weary from the battle. Henk stored his bolts, his mind already shifting to the next challenge. Bog, ever the joker, gave a mock salute. “Well, that was fun,” he said, though his voice carried a hint of exhaustion.

As they made their way out of the alley, the reality of their situation began to sink in. This ambush had been just the beginning. The Thayan Games were still ahead, and the dangers they had faced tonight were but a taste of what was to come. But for now, they had survived. Together, they would face whatever challenges lay ahead, united in their resolve to emerge victorious—or die trying.

After the brutal ambush in the alley, the adventurers staggered back to their lodging at the Pit of Endless Servitude, their bodies battered and their minds weary from the battle. The narrow streets of Thay were eerily quiet, save for the faint echoes of their footsteps and the occasional flicker of torchlight from distant watchtowers. It was late—around ten or ten-thirty—and the city seemed to be holding its breath, as if anticipating the next move in the deadly game they found themselves entangled in.

Eirik, ever the vigilant, split off from the group as they approached the lodging. His destination was clear: Inquisitor Madysek’s office. He marched with purpose, *Gravebreaker* dragging behind him, leaving a trail of sparks on the cobblestones. The others, exhausted from the fight, barely noticed his departure as they focused on finding rest. Corman, the paladin, was in the worst shape, his body barely holding together after the onslaught of blows he had taken. Thalrok, the goliath druid, scooped him up, carrying him like a child toward the nearest bed.

By the time they arrived, Corman was barely conscious, his eyes fluttering as he fought to stay awake. “Just... put me down,” he muttered weakly, his voice barely audible. Thalrok complied, gently lowering him onto a bed in one of the sparse rooms of the Pit. Corman’s breathing was labored, and it was clear he wouldn’t be moving anytime soon.

Meanwhile, Eirik had reached Madysek’s office. The Red Wizard looked up from his desk, his expression a mixture of exhaustion and alertness, as if he hadn’t slept in days but was still running on some arcane energy. Eirik didn’t waste time with pleasantries. He placed the skull mask of the undead assassin on the table before him.

“Is this what passes for gamesmanship in Thay?” Eirik’s voice was cold, his eyes locked on the wizard.

Madysek’s gaze flicked to the mask, his face hardening. “You’ve run into a Darakul,” he said, his tone grim. “Someone has placed a target on your back.”

Eirik’s jaw tightened. “What would the Probity Corps think of this? Is this in the spirit of the games, or have we been wronged?”

The Red Wizard met his gaze, his voice calm but firm. “You have been wronged. The Probity Corps will see to this matter. They will look into your thoughts and investigate the truth.”

Eirik nodded, satisfied for the moment. “I hope we find the one responsible for this bounty,” he said before turning to leave. He left the skull mask on the table as a silent reminder of the treachery they had faced. As he walked out of the office, the weight of his warhammer dragging behind him, he made his way back to the lodging, his mind already turning to the challenges ahead.

Back at the Pit of Endless Servitude, the rest of the group had settled in for the night. Bog, the satyr monk, had sobered up from his earlier drinks, though a slight hangover still lingered. He made his way to bed, eager for sleep. Thalrok, ever the protector, decided to share a room with Bog, offering a reassuring presence. “I’ll make sure nothing happens to you tonight,” the goliath said with a grin, his massive frame taking up most of the room.

Bog chuckled. “Thanks, Thalrok. Seems like not many people are fans of horns around here,” he said, referencing the disdainful looks he had received from the locals.

Meanwhile, Eirik had been wandering through the lodging, peeking into rooms to check on his companions. He found Corman wheezing heavily in his bed, clearly in no shape for conversation. Deciding not to disturb him, Eirik continued his search for an empty room. Eventually, he found one, doffed his armor, and laid down for a much-needed rest.

But not everyone was ready to sleep. Henk, the orc politician, had a different kind of appointment to keep. As he settled into his room, there was a knock at the door. The Red Wizard who managed the lodging stood there, accompanied by a Thayan slave. “You have a visitor,” the wizard said, his voice carrying a note of caution. “She presents certain dangers. Do you wish to see her?”

Henk’s curiosity piqued, he nodded. “Send her in immediately,” he said without hesitation. The Red Wizard, however, placed a hand on the door as Henk turned to walk away. “Certain precautions should be taken,” he warned, his voice grave. “She is... of an extraordinary nature.”

Henk, ever the charmer, waved off the concern. “I could tell that from the moment I spotted her,” he said with a grin.

Moments later, Miranda, the mysterious woman Henk had met earlier in the marketplace, appeared in the hallway. Her presence was both alluring and dangerous, and as she entered the room, the air between them crackled with tension. What began as a flirtatious encounter quickly turned darker. As they embraced, Henk felt a sudden draining sensation, as if the very life was being pulled from him. Miranda’s kiss was not one of passion, but of something far more sinister. Henk managed to resist the full force of the attack, but the damage was done—he had fallen prey to a *Draining Kiss*.

Despite the danger, Henk survived the encounter, though weakened. As Miranda left, he lay back on his bed, his mind racing. The night had been far more eventful than he had anticipated, and the consequences of his actions were yet to be fully realized.

As the rest of the group slept soundly, recovering from the day’s battles, Henk remained awake, his thoughts swirling. The games were only just beginning, and it was clear that they were playing for far more than just glory. Deception, danger, and dark magic lurked around every corner in Thay, and the adventurers would need to stay sharp if they hoped to survive.

With the morning light still hours away, the group rested, knowing that the challenges ahead would test their strength, their resolve, and their very souls.

The night in Thay had taken a dark turn. The adventurers, already weary from the ambush in the alley, had returned to their lodging at the Pit of Endless Servitude, hoping for a chance to recover before the next day’s trials. But as the city of necromancers and undead slumbered, a greater tragedy struck, one that would shake the group to its core.

Henk, the orc politician, had been lured into a deadly encounter by Miranda, a woman he had flirted with earlier in the marketplace. What he had thought would be a pleasurable rendezvous turned into something far more sinister. As she pressed herself against him, Henk’s mind cleared for just a moment, realizing too late the danger he was in. The life drained from his body in an instant, his essence torn from him by the succubus’s kiss. His final moments were filled with a searing pain, and suddenly, he was looking down at his own desiccated corpse from above, his soul slipping into the void. Henk was dead.

The next morning, the group awoke to grim news. A Red Wizard had come to their door, his face solemn as he informed them of their companion’s fate. “Henk has passed from the mortal plane,” he said, his voice heavy with the weight of the revelation. The wizard led them to Henk’s room, where they found the orc’s body twisted and lifeless, his skin gray and shriveled, his eyes sunken into dark pits. It was a gruesome sight, reminiscent of a scene from a horror tale. The succubus had left nothing behind but a hollow shell of the once vibrant and mischievous Henk.

Corman, the paladin of Lathander, was the first to react. His face twisted in disbelief as he pushed past the others, falling to his knees beside Henk’s body. “No... NO!” he cried out, his voice echoing through the room. His hands trembled as he reached out to touch his friend’s cold, lifeless form. It was clear that Corman, ever the protector, could not comprehend what had happened. “Where is he? Where did you take him? He’s coming back, right?” he asked, his voice desperate, as if clinging to the hope that this was all some cruel illusion.

The Red Wizard, Asko, shook his head. “Henk fell to otherworldly pleasures during the night. A succubus from the House of Priador visited him, and he succumbed to her charms,” he explained, his tone matter-of-fact, though there was a hint of pity in his eyes. “It is known that Priador has violated the rules of the games, and they will be punished accordingly.”

Bog, the satyr monk, leaned against the wall, his expression a mixture of sadness and resignation. “Henk went to a farm up north,” he muttered dryly, though his usual humor was absent. He knew, just as the others did, that there was no coming back from this. The succubus had claimed Henk’s soul, and there was no magic in Thay that could reverse such a fate.

Thalrok, the goliath druid, stepped forward, his voice deep and commanding. “How long ago did Henk pass?” he asked, his tone calm but filled with an underlying anger.

Asko glanced at the body, then back at the group. “It has been several hours. He was warned, but he chose to pursue the encounter despite our attempts to intervene.”

Eirik, the human fighter, had been silent up until now, his face a mask of fury. Without a word, he stormed past the others, his heavy boots thudding against the floor as he made his way to Henk’s room. He shouldered past the Red Wizard, not caring for the man’s explanations. When he saw Henk’s body, twisted and lifeless on the floor, something inside him snapped. His hands clenched into fists, his knuckles white as he struggled to contain his rage.

“This is the second time we’ve been wronged in a matter of hours,” Eirik growled, his voice low and dangerous. He turned to the group, his eyes blazing with fury. “We need to speak with Madysek again. This cannot go unpunished.”

Corman, still kneeling beside Henk’s body, looked up at Eirik, his face pale and drawn. “We need a name,” he said quietly, his voice barely above a whisper. “Who did this?”

Thalrok, his massive frame towering over the others, stepped forward. “It was a woman from the House of Priador,” he said, his voice rumbling like distant thunder. “We saw Henk give notes to two women in the marketplace. One of them must be the succubus.”

Asko, the Red Wizard, nodded. “The Probity Corps will investigate the matter. Priador has violated the rules, and they will be punished.”

But Corman was not satisfied. He surged to his feet, grabbing Asko by the scruff of his robes. “No,” he snarled, his eyes wild with grief and anger. “You will see to this matter personally. Our friend is dead, and we demand justice.”

Bog, standing nearby, crossed his arms and nodded in agreement. “We know who she is,” he said, his voice cold. “Henk was flirting with her in the market. It has to be her.”

Corman, his grip still tight on Asko’s robes, shook his head. “He was flirting with *all* the women in the market,” he muttered bitterly.

Thalrok placed a hand on Corman’s shoulder, gently pulling him back. “Let him go,” the druid said quietly. “The Probity Corps will handle this. There will be justice, but we must be patient.”

Eirik, meanwhile, had begun rifling through Henk’s belongings, his face grim as he collected the orc’s items. He picked up the *Bloodfire Ballista* and the *Stone of Silent Passage*, along with Henk’s coin purse, which contained a modest sum of gold. As he worked, Corman watched in disbelief, his face twisting with disgust.

“For Lathander’s sake, leave him be,” Corman said, his voice filled with sorrow.

Eirik snapped his head around, his eyes cold and hard. “If you don’t have the stomach for this, leave,” he said sharply, his hands continuing to gather Henk’s belongings. There was no room for sentimentality in Eirik’s world—only practicality.

Corman opened his mouth to protest, but no words came. Defeated, he turned and walked out of the room, his shoulders slumped in sorrow.

As Eirik finished collecting Henk’s things, he turned to Thalrok. “We need to be careful about how we proceed,” he said quietly. “Let the Probity Corps investigate this before we take any matters into our own hands.”

Thalrok nodded in agreement. “There will be justice,” he said, his voice steady. “But Henk will not be the last to fall. We must be prepared.”

With that, the group left the room, leaving Henk’s desiccated body behind. The weight of their loss hung heavy in the air, but there was no time to dwell on it. The Thayan Games were still ahead, and the dangers they faced were only growing. Together, they would face whatever challenges lay ahead, united in their resolve to emerge victorious—or die trying, just as Henk had.

As they made their way to confront Madysek once more, the cold reality of Thay settled over them like a shroud. This was a land of treachery, where even the dead could not rest easy. And the games had only just begun.

Tensions were running high as the adventurers gathered in the dimly lit room, their minds reeling from the events of the previous night. Henk, their once vibrant and mischievous companion, was no longer with them. Yet, as they stood before Inquisitor Mades, the truth of his death had been erased from their minds, replaced by a vague and unsettling memory of Henk wandering off into the city, lost on some cryptic journey. Only Thalrok, the goliath druid, had managed to resist the invasive spell that had altered their memories, and he alone remembered the horrifying truth—that Henk had been killed by a succubus.

Eirik, the human fighter, stood at the forefront of the group, his brow furrowed as he addressed the Inquisitor. "What actions will be taken for the two slights against the Lord’s Alliance?" His voice was calm, but there was an undercurrent of frustration. He had already lost one companion, and the attack by the Darakul on the way back from the opening ceremonies still weighed heavily on his mind.

Mades, the Inquisitor of the Probity Corps, met Eirik’s gaze with a cool, calculating expression. "The slights you refer to include the death of your friend," he began, his tone matter-of-fact. He paused for a moment, as if searching for the right words, before continuing. "The Darakul you fought had no distinguishing markings, but I will bring this matter before the other Thayan officials. The Probity Corps has the utmost authority, and justice will be brought. Such violence is not part of the games and is against the rules."

Eirik nodded, though his frustration remained. "And what of the attack on us by the Darakul? What will be done about that?"

Without asking for permission, the Inquisitor reached out with his mind, casting *Detect Thoughts* on Eirik. The fighter, ever pragmatic, didn’t resist. "Welcome to my mind," he said with a slight smirk. "You need only ask next time; I have nothing to hide."

The Inquisitor’s eyes twitched slightly as he sifted through Eirik’s thoughts, searching for the truth. After a moment, he straightened, his expression unreadable. "The Darakul attack will be investigated," he said. "The Probity Corps will see to it. But as for your other slight..." His gaze shifted to Madesek, the Red Wizard who had been overseeing the group’s participation in the games. "Gather around," the Inquisitor commanded.

Eirik, Corman, and Bog hesitated for a moment, but they complied, stepping closer to the Inquisitor. Thalrok, however, remained at a distance, his arms crossed as he watched the scene unfold. The goliath had no intention of letting the Inquisitor into his mind, not after witnessing the manipulation of his companions' memories.

"Please, open your minds," the Inquisitor said, raising his hands as he prepared to cast *Modify Memory*. Eirik bowed his head, allowing the spell to take hold. Corman, ever the devout paladin, began to mutter a prayer to Lathander under his breath, hoping that his god would protect him from the invasive magic. Bog, though hesitant, also lowered his defenses, trusting that the Inquisitor’s intentions were just.

The spell took hold, and in an instant, the memory of Henk’s death was wiped from their minds. No longer did they remember the succubus or the tragic events of the night before. Instead, they believed that Henk had wandered off into the city, lost and unreachable. The group now thought that Henk had made some cryptic statement about leaving on a greater journey, and despite their attempts to convince him otherwise, he had disappeared into the night.

As the spell faded, Eirik couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t quite right. He glanced down at the *Bloodfire Ballista* and the *Stone of Silent Passage* that he had taken from Henk’s belongings. Why would he have these items if Henk had simply wandered off? The memory in his mind seemed clear, but there was a nagging doubt that he couldn’t ignore.

Thalrok, who had successfully resisted the spell, remained silent, his mind racing as he processed the situation. He alone remembered the truth, but for now, he chose to keep that knowledge to himself. There was a time and place for revealing such information, and this was not it.

Madesek, sensing the unease in the room, stepped forward. "The games are about to begin," he reminded them. "If your friend is unable to attend the Necromancy Rites as scheduled, the Lord’s Alliance will forfeit the event."

Eirik, still grappling with the contradictions in his memory, turned to the Inquisitor. "In events like this, where a competitor is... missing... what can we do about a replacement?"

The Inquisitor’s response was measured. "The presiding rules are up to the Thark that hosts the games. In the past, rules have been explicit about an automatic forfeiture when a competitor dies or disappears. Such a loss is considered a great shame."

Eirik frowned. "Not just for that one event, but what about our delegation receiving another member?"

The Inquisitor paused, considering the question. "The games have not yet started. If there is flexibility, now is the time to seek it. If you can find a wayward soul from the Lord’s Alliance within the next few hours, it may help your case."

Thalrok, his patience wearing thin, stepped forward. "Should we find our lost companion?" he asked, his voice low but steady. He knew full well that Henk was not simply lost, but he played along with the altered memory for now.

Eirik, growing visibly frustrated, asked, "Have you any news of the companions we arrived with originally? We’ve not seen them."

The Inquisitor’s response was curt. "No."

Eirik’s frustration boiled over. "Well, will anyone here know? Who might?"

The Inquisitor’s tone grew sharp, a hiss of irritation creeping into his voice. "The Probity Corps is investigating these ridiculous claims of missing companions. Patience, honored guests."

Thalrok, not fooled by the Inquisitor’s deflections, shot him a cold look. "You have taken the Lord’s Alliance for granted," he said, his voice filled with quiet menace. "There will come a time when you see our true power."

Corman, still reeling from the loss of Henk and the weight of the upcoming games, nodded in agreement. "That’s right," he muttered, his voice filled with a grim determination.

As the adventurers prepared to leave, the weight of their situation pressed down on them. They had lost a companion, and though the memory of Henk’s death had been erased, the consequences of that loss were still very real. The Thayan Games were about to begin, and they would need every ounce of strength, cunning, and resolve to survive the trials ahead.

But even as they steeled themselves for the challenges to come, one thought lingered in the back of their minds: where had Henk gone? And would they ever see him again?

As the sun climbed high over the oppressive city of Thay, the adventurers found themselves grappling with a grim reality. The events of the past few hours weighed heavily on their minds, and the loss of their companion, Henk, still hung over them like a dark cloud. They had returned to the Pit of Endless Servitude, hoping for answers, but instead had found themselves deep in confusion. For most of the group, the memory of Henk’s death had been altered—erased by the mind games of the Thayan Inquisitors. Only Thalrok, the goliath druid, had resisted the spell, and he alone knew the truth: Henk had fallen victim to a succubus, and his soul was lost.

But the others, unaware of the true nature of Henk’s demise, believed he had simply wandered off, lost on some cryptic journey. It was a lie, implanted in their minds by the Inquisitors, but one that they now accepted as truth. Eirik, the human fighter, was particularly unsettled. He had Henk’s belongings—the *Bloodfire Ballista* and the *Stone of Silent Passage*—but couldn’t quite grasp why. The memory of Henk’s departure felt wrong, like a puzzle piece that didn’t fit. He scratched his head, staring at the ballista, and turned to Thalrok. “What’s the meaning of this?” he asked, his voice tinged with frustration.

Thalrok, knowing full well the truth, remained calm. “They’re playing mind games with us. Henk is dead. That’s all you have left—his things. We need to get out of here. We need to find a replacement. And I believe the best place to start is the signal we’ve been receiving.”

Eirik nodded, though his mind still struggled to reconcile the gaps in his memory. “What of Henk’s death?” he pressed. “What do you know? How was he killed? Where did it happen?”

Thalrok’s face darkened. “I don’t know exactly what happened,” he admitted, “but I know who it was. And we will get justice.”

The group fell into a tense silence, each of them processing the situation in their own way. Corman, the paladin of Lathander, was the most resistant. He refused to believe that Henk was truly gone. “He was just with us last night,” Corman muttered, shaking his head. “He went off on his journey. He’s still out there.”

Bog, the satyr monk, had his own suspicions. “If he’s alive,” Bog said grimly, “he probably doesn’t want to be. God knows who has him now.”

Eirik, ever the pragmatist, placed the *Bloodfire Ballista* on the ground and handed it to Thalrok. “This would be of better use with you than me,” he said. Then, pulling out the *Stone of Silent Passage*, he tapped it, sending out a silent pulse, hoping to reach any of their missing companions. But the stone remained silent. No response came.

The group knew they had little time. The Thayan Games were set to begin, and they were already down a member. If they didn’t find a replacement soon, they would be forced to forfeit one of the events. The signal they had been receiving for the past thirteen hours was their only lead, and they had to investigate it before the games started. Eirik, his jaw set in determination, agreed. “Before we begin the games for the day, perhaps it’s worth investigating the signal.”

With that, the adventurers set out, making their way through the mage district, their minds heavy with thoughts of loss and betrayal. As they walked, each of them fell into their own silent ruminations.

Eirik’s thoughts drifted to his warhammer, *Gravebreaker*. He held it in both hands, inspecting the haft and the head of the weapon. The proprietor who had sold it to him had hinted at great power within the maul, and Eirik couldn’t help but wonder what opportunities lay ahead. He had always been a man of action, and now, with the games looming, he felt that the time to prove himself was near.

Thalrok, too, was deep in thought. His confrontation with Corman had shaken him, but it had also reminded him of why he was here. He wasn’t just competing in the games for personal glory—he was doing it for his people. The goliath clan he hailed from had suffered a great loss, and winning the games was his chance to restore their honor. But the weight of that responsibility pressed down on him like a stone, and he couldn’t help but think of his fallen friend, Henk.

Bog’s thoughts were more practical. He was still trying to piece together the events of the past day, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being treated unfairly. “Everything’s nefarious around here,” he muttered to himself. “If they took Henk, there’s no telling what they’ll do next.”

Corman, still clinging to the hope that Henk was alive, turned to Bog. “Where do you think he is? You think he’s still out there?”

Bog shook his head. “If he’s alive, he’s in trouble. And if he’s dead... well, we’ll find out soon enough.”

As the group continued their journey toward the signal, they couldn’t help but feel the weight of the Thayan Games pressing down on them. They had already lost one member, and the games hadn’t even begun. The Lord’s Alliance, once a symbol of strength and unity, now found itself fractured and vulnerable in a land ruled by deception and dark magic.

But they pressed on, determined to find answers—and perhaps a new ally—before the games began. The signal they were following was their only lead, and time was running out. With each step, the desert loomed closer, and the adventurers knew that whatever awaited them on the other side, they would face it together.

For now, they were still a team. But in Thay, nothing was certain. The games had yet to begin, but already, the Lord’s Alliance was playing a game of survival. And in this land of necromancers, where even the dead could not rest easy, survival was the only victory that mattered.
